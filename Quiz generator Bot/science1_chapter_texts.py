(Dr.Sunil Magar) Director  Maharashtra State Bureau of Textbook  and Curriculum Research, Pune Pune Date   :   18 March 2018, Gudhipadva     Indian Solar Year : 27 Phalgun 1939 F   In  Standards I to V we have told the simplescience in day to day life through the study  of surroundings. In VI to VIII standard we have given brief introduction to science. In the  textbook 'Science and Technology' for standard IX we have given the relation between   science and technology.    The real objective of scienceeducationis to learn to be able to think logically and with   discretion about events that are happening around us.    In view of the age group of Std X students, it would be appropriate, in the process of science  education, to give freedom and scope to the students™ own curiosity about the events of the  world, their propensity to go looking for the causes behind them and to their own initiative  and capacity to take the lead.    As  experimental skills are necessary for observation, logic, estimation, comparison and  application of information obtained in science education, deliberate efforts must be made  to develop these skills while dealing with laboratory experiments given in the textbook.   All observations that the students have noted should be accepted, and then they should be   helped to achieve the expected results.   These two years in middle school lay the foundation of higher education in Science.  Hence,  it is our responsibility to enrich and enhance student's  interest in science. You all will of   course always activelypursue the objective of imbuing them with a scientific temper in   them and developing their creativity and along with internet and skill.   Y ou can use ‚Let™s recall™ to review the previous knowledge required for a lesson and ‚Can  you tell?™ to introduce a topic by eliciting all the knowledge that the students already have   about it from their own reading or experience. You may of course use any of your own   activities or questions that occur to you for this purpose. Activities given under ‚Try this™   and ‚Let™s try this™ help to explain the content of the lesson. The former are for students   to do themselvesand the latter are those that you are expected to demonstrate. ‚Use your   brain power!™ is meant for application of previous knowledge for the new lesson, and   ‚Always remember™ gives important suggestions/information or values. ‚Research™, ‚Find   out™, ‚Do you know?™, ‚Introduction to scientists™ and ‚Institutes at work™ are meant to give   some information about the world outside the textbook and to develop the habit of doing   independent reference work to obtain additional information.   This textbook  is not only meant for reading and explaining in the classroom but is also  for guiding students to learn the methods of gaining knowledge by carrying out the given   activities. An informal atmosphere in the classroom is required to achievethe aims of this   textbook. maximum number of students should be encouraged to participate in discussions,   experiments and activities. Special efforts should be made to organise presentations or  report-reading in the class based on students™ activities and projects, besides observing of  Science Day and other relevant occasions/ days.

Science  and technology part 1 contains ten chapters mainly related to physics and chemistry. While thinking about science and technology, it is expected that an integrated  approach will be taken while teaching and a connection will be made  between  different components of science and technology. In previous standards, we have   studied various topics in science and technology together. For technical case two   separate books science and technology part 1 and part 2 have been prepared, but it  is necessary that an integrated perspective be taken while teaching.   Out of the ten chapters included in text book science and technology part 1, the  first five chapters are expected  to be taught in the first session while the next five  chapters in the second session. At the end of a session a written examination for 40   marks and a practical examination for ten marks should be conducted. Exercises  and projects have been given at the end of every chapters in the text book.   In  view of evaluation, representative questions similar to those in the activity  sheets of language books are given in exercises. You may make similar other  questions for your use.  The students should be evaluated based on these questions   detailed information above to this will be given in separate evaluation scheme. 1 1. What are the effects of a force acting on an object?  2. What types of forces are you familiar with?  3. What do you know about the gravitational force?  1. Gravitation    We have seen in the previous standard that the gravitational force is a universal force  and it acts  not only between two objects on the earth but also between any two objects in  the universe. Let us now learn how this force was discovered. Gravitation As we have learnt, the phenomenon of gravitation was discovered by Sir Isaac  Newton. As the story goes, he discovered the force by seeing an apple fall from a tree on  the ground. He wondered why all apples fall vertically downward and not at an angle to  the vertical. Why do they not fly off in a horizontal direction?  After much thought, he came to the conclusion that the earth must be attracting the  apple towards itself and this attractive force must be directed towards the center of the   earth. The direction from the apple on the treeto the center of the earth is the vertical  direction at the position of the apple and thus, the apple falls vertically downwards.     Figure 1.1 on the left shows an apple tree  on the earth. The force on an apple on the tree  is towards the center of the earth i.e. along the  perpendicular from the position of the apple  to the surface of the earth. The Figure also  shows the gravitational force between the   earth and the moon. The distances in the  figure are not according to scale.   Gravitation         Circular motion and centripetal force     Kepler™s laws        Newton™s universal law of gravitation       Acceleration due to the gravitational force of the Earth     Free fall                          Escape velocity    Newton thought that if the force of  gravitation acts on apples on the tree at   different heights from the surface of the earth,  can it also act on objects at even greater  heights, much farther away from the earth,  like for example, the moon? Can it act on   even farther objects like the other planets and  the Sun? Use of ICT :   Collect videos and ppts about the gravitational force of different planets. Force and Motion   We have seen that a force is necessary to change the speed as well as the direction of  motion of an object.  1.1 Concept of the gravitational force and  the gravitational force between the earth  and the moon. What are Newton™s laws of motion? Moon Gravitational force Earth Falling  apple Can you recall? Can you recall? . 2 Introduction to scientist Great Scientists: Sir Isaac Newton (1642-1727) was one of  the greatest scientists of recent times. He was born in England.  He gave his laws of motion, equations of motion and theory of   gravity in his book Principia. Before this book was written,   Kepler had given three laws describing planetary motions.   However, the reason why planets move in the way described by   Kepler™s laws was not known. Newton, with his theory of   gravity, mathematically derived Kepler™s laws.  Try this   Tie a stone to one end of a string. Take the other end in your  hand and rotate the string so that the stone moves along a circle  as shown in figure 1.2 a. Are you applying any force on the  stone? In which direction is this force acting?  How will you  stop this force from acting? What will be the effect on the stone?  As long as we are holding the string, we are pulling the  stone towards us i.e. towards the centre of the circle and are   applying a force towards it. The force stops acting if we release   the string. In this case, the stone will fly off along a straight line   which is the tangent to the circle at the position of the stone   when the string is released, because that is the direction of its  velocity at that instant of time (Figure 1.2 b). You may recall  that we have performed a similar activity previously in which a  5 rupee coin kept on a rotating circular disk flies off the disk   along the tangent to the disk. Thus, a force acts on any object   moving along a circle and it is directed towards the centre of the   circle. This is called the  Centripetal force.   ‚ Centripetal™ means  centre seeking, i.e. the object tries to go towards the centre of the   circle because of this force.  1.2 A stone tied to a string,   moving along a circular   path and its velocity in  tangential direction In addition to this, Newton did ground breaking work in several areas including  light, heat, sound and mathematics. He invented a new branch of mathematics. This is   called calculus and has wide ranging applications in physics and mathematics. He was   the  first scientist to construct a reflecting telescope.  You know that the moon, which is the natural satellite of the earth, goes round it in a  definite orbit. The direction of motion of the moon as well as its speed constantly changes   during this motion. Do you think some force is constantly acting on the moon? What must   be the direction of this force? How would its motion have been if no such force actedon   it? Do the other planets in the solar system revolve around the Sun in a similar fashion? Is   similar force acting on them? What must be its direction? From the above activity, example and questions it is clear that for the moon to go  around the earth, there must be a force which is exerted on the moon and this force must   be exerted  by the earth which attracts the moon towards itself. Similarly, the Sun must be   attracting the planets, including the earth, towards itself.   Circular motion and Centripetal force b. a. 3   An ellipse is the curve obtainedwhen  a cone is cut by an inclined plane. It has  two focal points. The sum of the distances   to the two focal points from every point   on the curve is constant. F 1  and F 2  are two  focal points of the ellipse shown in figure   1.3.  If A, B and C are three points on the   ellipse then,   AF 1  + AF 2   = BF 1  + BF 2   = CF 1  + CF 2   Kepler™s Laws Planetary motion had been observed by astronomers since ancient times.Before  Galileo, all observations of the planet™s positions were made with naked eyes. By the 16th  century a lot of data were available about planetary positions and motion. Johannes   Kepler, studied these data. He noticed that the motion of planets follows certain laws. He   stated three laws describing planetary motion. These are known as Kepler™s laws which   are given below.  1.3 An ellipse The straight lines AS and CS sweep equal area in equal interval of time i.e. area ASB  and CSD are equal.   1.4  The orbit of a planet moving  around the Sun.     The orbit of a planet is an ellipse  with the Sun at one of the foci.    Figure 1.4 shows the elliptical orbit of  a planet revolving around the sun. The  position of the Sun is indicated by S. Kepler™s second law  :      The line joining the planet and the  Sun sweeps equal areas in equal intervals  of time.    AB and CD are distances covered by  the planet in equal time i.e. after equal in - tervals of time, the positions of the planet  starting from A and C are shown by B and  D respectively. Kepler™s third law   :      The square of its period of revolution around the Sun is directly proportional to  the cube of the mean distance of a planet from the Sun. Thus, if r is the average distance of the planet from the Sun and T is its period of  revolution then,   T 2  a r 3   i.e. Kepler™s first law  :   A C F 1 F 2 Kepler obtained these laws simply from the study of the positions of planets obtained  by regular observations. He had no explanation as to why planets obey these laws. We  will see below how these laws helped Newton in the formulation of his theory of gravitation. Do you know ? T 2 r 3 =   constant  =  K  ............. (1) B A B C D S E F 1 Sun Planet 2 3 4 From equation (2), it can be seen that  the value of G is the gravitational force  acting between two unit masses kept at a   unit distance away from each other. Thus,   in SI units, the value of G is equal to the   gravitational force between two masses of  1 kg kept 1 m apart.     Show that in SI units, the unit of G  is Newton m 2  kg -2 . The value of G was  first experimentally measured by Henry  Cavendish. In SI units its value is  6.673 x 10 -11  N m 2  kg -2 .   Use your brain power If the area ESF in  figure 1.4 is equal to area ASB, what  will you infer about EF?    An introduction to scientists Johannes Kepler (1571-1630) was a German astronomer  and mathematician. He started working as a helper to the famous  astronomer Tycho Brahe in Prague in 1600.  After the sudden  death of Brahe in 1601, Kepler was appointed as the Royal   mathematician in his place.Kepler used the observations of   planetary positions made by Brahe to discover the laws of   planetary motion.  He wrote several books. His work was later   used by Newton in postulating his law of gravitation.  1.5 Gravitational force between  two objects    Figure  1.5 shows two objectswith masses m 1  and  m 2  kept at a distance d from each other. Mathematically,  the gravitational force of attraction between these two   bodies can be written as m 1 m 2    d 2 F a ....... (2) m 1 m 2    d 2 F  G  or Newton™s universal law of gravitation   All the above considerations including Kepler ™s laws led Newton to formulate his  theory of Universal gravity. According to this theory, every object in the Universe attracts  every other object with a definite force. This force is directly proportional to the product  of the masses of the two objects and is inversely proportional to the square of the distance  between them.   Here, G is the constant of proportionality and is called the Universal gravitational  constant. The above law means that if the mass of one object is doubled, the force between the  two objects also doubles. Also, if the distance is doubled, the force decreases by a factor  of 4. If the two bodies are spherical, the direction of the force is always along the line   joiningthe centres of the two bodies and the distance betweenthe centres is taken to be d.   In case when the bodies are not spherical or have irregular shape, then the direction of   force is along the line joining their centres of mass and d is taken to be the distance   between the two centres of mass. d   Use your brain power 5   The dist ance travelled by the planet in one revolution =perimeter of the orbit 2   r ; r = distance of the planet from the Sun, Time taken = Period of revolution = T Why did Newton assume inverse square dependence on distance in his law of  gravitation? He was helped by Kepler™s third law in this as shown below.   Uniform circular motion / Magnitude of centripetal force Consider an object moving in a circle with constant speed. We have seen earlier that  such a motion is possible only when the object is constantly acted upon by a force directed  towards the centre of the circle. This force is called the centripetal force. If m is the mass  of the object, v is its speed and r is the radius of the circle,then it can be shown that this  force is equal to F = m v 2 /r.   If a planet is revolving around the Sun in a circular  orbit in uniform circular motion, then the centripetal force   acting on the planet towards the Sun must be F = mv 2 /r,   where, m is the mass of the planet, v is its speed and r is its  distance from the Sun.   The speed of the planetcan be expressed in terms of the period of revolution T as  follows.   The centre of mass of an object is the point inside or outside the object at which the  total mass of the object can be assumed to be concentrated. The centre of mass of a   spherical object having uniform density is at its geometrical centre. The centre of mass   of any object having uniform density is at its centroid.   Thus, Newton concluded that the centripetal force which is the force acting on the  planet and is responsible for its circular motion, must be inversely proportional to the   square of the distance between the planet and the Sun. Newton identified this force with   the force of gravity and hence postulated the inverse square law of gravitation.The   gravitational force is much weaker than other forces in nature but it controls the Universe   and decides its future.  This is possible because of the huge masses of planets, stars and   other constituents of the Universe.   Is there a gravitational force between two objects kept on a table or between you  and your friend sitting next to you? If yes, why don™t the two move towards each other? Use your brain power Speed   =  distance travelled  time taken 4 m  2        T 2 ( r 3 (   F =                 T 2 r 3 =  K , multiplying and dividing by r 2   we get, 4 m  2       r 2  K F   =           mv 2     r   F =                =  2   r T ) ( 2 r =  4 m  2  r T 2 m v  =                                   =          2 r              T        distance travelled           time  taken   .  According to Kepler™s third law, 4 m  2       K ,  But =   Constant   r 2 1   r 2 1   r 2  F = constant    F 6 Example 1 :  Mahendra and Virat are sitting  at a distance of 1 metre from each other. Their  masses are 75 kg and 80 kg respectively.   What is the gravitational force between them?  Given :   r = 1 m, m 1  = 75 kg, m 2  = 80 kg and  G = 6.67 x 10  -11  Nm 2 /kg 2 According to Newton™s law F =  G m 1 m 2     r 2           6.67 x 10 -11  x 75 x 80   1 2 N F  = = 4.002 x 10 -7  N  The gravitational force between Mahendra  and Virat is 4.002 x 10 -7  N This is a very small force. If the force of  friction between Mahendra and the bench on   which he is sitting is zero, then he will start   moving towards Virat under the action of   this force. We can calculate his acceleration    and velocity by using Newton™s laws of mo -  tion.  Example 2 :  In the above example, assuming  that the bench on which Mahendra is sitting   is frictionless, starting with zero velocity,   what will be Mahendra™s velocity of motion   towards Virat after 1 s ? Will this velocity  change with time and how?  Assuming the bench to be frictionless, v = 0 + 5.34 x 10 -9  x 1 m/s      =  5.34 x 10 -9  m/s   Mahendra™s velocity after 1 s will be  5.34 x 10 -9  m/s .      This is an extremely small velocity.   The velocity will increase with time because  of the acceleration. The acceleration will   also not remain constant because as   Mahendra moves towards Virat, the   distance between them will decrease,    causing an increase in the gravitational   force, thereby  increasing the acceleration    as per Newton™s second law of motion. a  =         =  F m   4.002   x 10 -7         75 = 5.34 x 10 -9   m/s 2  Assuming the acceleration in Example2 above remains   constant, how long will Mahendra take to move 1 cm   towards Virat?   You must  be knowing about the high and  low tides that occur regularly in the sea. The   level of sea water at any given location along   sea shore increases and decreases twice a day   at regular intervals. High and low tides occur at   different times at different places. The level of   water in the sea changes because of the   gravitational force exerted by the moon. Water  Low tide High   tide directly under the moon gets pulled towards the moon and the level of water there goes up   causing high tide at that place. At two places on the earth at  90 o  from the place of high  tide, the level of water is minimum and low tides occur there as shown in figure 1.6 1.6  Low and high tides Solved examples   Use your brain power ! Do you know ? Given :  Force on Mahendra =  F = 4.002 x  10  -7  N, Mahendra™s mass = m = 75 kg    According to Newton™s second law, the  acceleration produced by the force on  Mahendra = m = 75 kg. Using Newton™s first equation, we can     calculateMahendra™s velocity after 1s,  Newton™s first equation of motion is  v = u + a t; As Mahendra is sitting on the bench, his  initial velocity is zero (u=0) 7 Earth™ gravitational force   W ill the velocity of a stone thrown vertically upwards remain constant or will it change  with time? How will it change? Why doesn™t the stone move up all the time? Why does it fall  down after reaching a certain height? What does its maximum height depend on ?   The earth attracts every object near it towards itself because of the gravitational force.  The centre of mass of the earth is situated at its centre, so the gravitational force on any object   due to the earth is always directed towards the centre of the earth. Because of this force, an   object falls vertically downwards on the earth.  Similarly, when we throw a stone vertically upwards, this force tries to pull it down and  reduces its velocity. Due to this constant downward pull, the velocity becomes zero after a  while. The pull continues to be exerted and the stone starts moving vertically downward  towards the centre of the earth under its influence. Example 1:  Calculate the gravitational force   due to the earth on Mahendra in the earlier   example.

Observe the  timing of high and low tides at one place when you go for a picnic to be a beach. Take  pictures and hold an exhibition.   According to Newton™s law of gravitation, every  object attracts every other object.    Thus, if the earth attracts an apple towards itself, the apple also attracts the  earth to - wards itself with the same force. Why then does the apple fall towards the earth, but the  earth does not move towards the apple? The gravitational force due to the earth also acts on the moon because of which it  revolves around the earth. Similar situation exists for the artificial satellites orbiting the   earth. The moon and the artificial satellites orbit the earth. The earth attracts them towards   itself but unlike the falling apple, they do not fall on the earth, why? This is because of the  velocity of the moon and the satellites along their orbits. If this velocity was not there, they  would have fallen on the earth.               Solved Examples  Use your brain power ! 8   This acceleration depends only on the mass  M and radius R of the earth and so the  acceleration due to gravity at a given point on the earth is the same for all objects. It does not  depend on the properties of the object. What would be the value of g on the surface of the earth if its   mass was twice as large and its radius half of what it is now? Think about it Earth™s gravitational acceleration      The earth exerts gravitational force on objects near it. According to Newton™s second law   of motion, a force acting on a body results in its acceleration. Thus, the gravitational force due   to the earth on a body results in its acceleration. This is called acceleration due to gravity and   is denoted by ‚g™.  Acceleration is a vector. As the gravitational force on any object due to the   earth is directed towards the centre of the earth, the direction of the acceleration due to grav - ity is also directed towards the centre of the earth i.e. vertically downwards. 1. What would happen if there were no gravity?  2. What would happen if the value of G was twice as large? Value of g on the surface of the earth G M m      r 2 F =                     ............. (3)    We can calculate the value of g by using Newton™s universal law of gravitation for an  object of mass m situated at a distance r from the centre of the earth. The law of gravitation   gives  F = m g     ................... (4) G M    r 2 g =                ............ (5)                          M is the mass of the earth.  G M    R 2 g =   ......... (6)     From (3) and (4),  The unit of g in SI units is m/s 2.  The mass and radius of the earth  are 6 x10 24  kg and 6.4x10 6  m, respectively. Using these in (6)  g =  (6.4 x 10 6  ) 2  6.67 x 10 -11  x 6 x 10 24 = 9.77 m/s 2   ......................... (7) If the object is situated on the surface of the earth, r = R = Radius  of the earth.  Thus, the value of g on the surface of the earth is. Can you tell? G M m     r 2 mg =  Variation in value of g A. Change along the surface of the earth :  Willthe value of g be the same everywhere on  the surface of the earth? The answer is no. The reason is that the shape of the earth is not ex - actlyspherical and so the distanceof a point on the surface of the earth from its centre differs   somewhat from place to place. Due to its rotation, the earth bulges at the equator and is flatter   at the poles. Its radius is largest at the equator and smallest at the poles. The value of g is thus   highest (9.832 m/s 2 ) at the poles and decreases slowly with decreasing latitude. It is lowest  (9.78 m/s 2 ) at the equator.  B. Change with height :  As we go above the earth™s surface, the value of r in equation (5)  increases and the value of g decreases. However, the decrease is rather small for heights   which are small in comparison to the earth™s radius. For example, remember that the radius   of the earth is 6400 km. If an aeroplane is flying at a height 10 km above the surface of the   earth, its distance from the earth™s surface changes from 6400 km to 6410 km and the change   in the value of g due to it  is negligible. On the other hand, when we consider an artificial   satellite orbiting the earth, we have to take into account the change in the value of g due to the   large change in the distance of the satellite from the centre of the earth. Some typical heights   and the values of g at these heights are given in the following table. 9 Place Height (km) g (m/s 2 ) Surface of the earth (average) 0 9.8 Mount Everest 8.8  9.8 Maximum heightreached by man - made balloon  36.6 9.77 Height of a typical weather satellite 400 8.7 Height of communication satellite 35700 0.225 1.7 Table showing change of g with height above the earth™s surface 1. Will the direction of the gravitational force change as we go  inside the earth? 2. What will be the value of g at the centre of the earth? Every planet and satellite has different mass and radius. Hence, according to equation  (6), the values of g on their surfaces are different.  On the moon it is about 1/6 th  of the value  on the earth. As a result, using the same amount of force, we can jump 6 times higher on  the moon as compared to that on the earth.  Mass and Weight  Mass :  Mass is the amount of matter present in the object. The SI unit of mass is kg. Mass   is a scalar quantity. Its value is same everywhere. Its value does not change even when we   go to another planet. According to Newton™s first law, it is the measure of the inertiaof an   object. Higher the mass, higher is the inertia.  Weight :  The weight of an object is defined as the force with which the earth attracts the   object. The force (F) on an object of mass m on the surface of the earth can be written   using equation (4) C. Change with depth  : The value of g also changes if we go inside the earth. The value  of r in equation (5) decreases and one would think that the value of g should increase as  per the formula. However, the part of the earth which contributes towards the gravitation - al force felt by the object also decreases.  Which means that the value of M to be used in  equation (5) also decreases. As a combined result of change in r and M, the value of g  decreases as we go deep inside the earth. Weight, W = F = m g   ....   (                   )       G M    R 2 g =     Colloquially we use weight for both mass and weight and measure the weight in  kilograms which is the unit of mass. But in scientific language when we say that Rajeev™s   weight is 75 kg, we are talking about Rajeev™s mass. What we mean is that Rajeev™s   weight is equal to the gravitational force on 75 kg mass. As Rajeev™s mass is 75 kg, his   weight on earth is F = mg = 75 x 9.8 = 735 N. The weight of 1 kg mass is 1 x 9.8 = 9.8   N. Our weighing machines tell us the mass.  The two scale balances in shops compare   two weights i.e. two masses. Think about it   Weight being a force, its SI unit is Newton.  Also, the weight, being a force, is a vector  quantity and its direction is towards the centre of the earth.  As the value of g is not same   everywhere, the weight of an object changes from place to place, though its mass is   constant everywhere. 10 Gravitational waves   Waves are createdon the surface of water when we drop a stone into it. Similarly  you must have seen the waves generated on a string when both its ends are held in hand  and it is shaken. Light is also a type of wave called the electromagnetic wave. Gamma  rays, X-rays, ultraviolet rays, infrared rays, microwave and radio waves are all different  types of electromagnetic waves. Astronomical objects emitthese waves and we receive  themusing our instruments.All our knowledge about the universe has been obtained   through these waves.   Gravitational waves are a very different  type of waves. They have been called the  waves on the fabric of space-time. Einstein predicted their existence in 1916. These   waves are very weak and it is very difficultto detect them. Scientists have constructed  extremely sensitive instruments to detectthe gravitationalwaves emitted by astronomical  sources. Among these, LIGO (Laser Interferometric Gravitational Wave Observatory)  is the prominent one. Exactly after hundred years of their prediction, scientists detected  these waves coming from an astronomical source.  Indian scientists have contributed   significantly in this discovery. This discovery has opened a new path to obtain  information about the Universe. 1.

We can write the  weight on moon as mg m  (g m  is the acceleration due to gravity on the moon). Thus g m  is 1/6 th  of the g on the earth. = 11 Free fall Try this   Take a small stone. Hold it in your hand. Which forces are acting  on the stone? Now release the stone. What do you observe? What are  the forces acting on the stone after you release it?  v = g t v 2  = 2 g s s =      g t 2 1  2   For calc ulating the motion of an objectthrown upwards, accelera - tion is negative, i.e. in a direction opposite to the velocity and is taken to   be  Œ g. The magnitude of g is the same but the velocity of the object   decreases because of this -ve acceleration.   The moon and the artificial  satellites are moving only under the in - fluence of the gravitational field of the earth. Thus they are in free fall.    We know that the force of gravity due to the earth acts on each and every object.  When we were holding the stone in our hand, the stone was experiencing this force, but it  was balanced by a force that we were applying on it in the opposite direction. As a result,  the stone remained at rest. Once we release the stone from our hands, the only force that  acts on it is the gravitational force of the earth and the stone falls down under its influence.  Whenever an objectmoves under the influence of the force of gravity alone, it is said to be  falling freely. Thus the released stone is in a free fall. In free fall, the initial velocity of the  objectis zero and goes on increasing due to the acceleration due to gravity of the earth.   During free fall, the frictional force due to air opposes the motion of the object and a buoy - ant force also acts on the object. Thus, true free fall is possible only in vacuum. For a freely falling object, the velocity on reaching the earth and the time taken for it  can be calculated by using Newton™s equations of motion. For free fall, the initial velocity  u = 0 and the acceleration a = g. Thus we can write the equations as     The value of g is the same for all objectsat a given placeon the earth. Thus, any  two objects,irrespective of theirmasses or any other properties, when dropped from the   same height and falling freely will reach the earth at the same time. Galileo is said to  have performed an experiment around 1590 in the Italian city of Pisa. He dropped two  spheres of different masses from the leaning tower of Pisa to demonstrate that both  spheres reached the ground at the same time.  When we drop a feather and a heavy stone at the same time from a height, they do  not reach the earth at the same time. The feather experiences a buoyant force and a   frictional force due to air and therefore floats and reaches the ground slowly, later than  the heavy stone. The buoyant and frictional forces on the stone are much less than the  weight of the stone and does not affect the speed of the stone much. Recently, scientists  performedthis experiment in vacuum and showed that the featherand stone indeed  reach the earth at the same time. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRNC5kcvINA                               Do you know ? 12 1 2 s = u t  +       a t 2                 Now let us consider the downward  motion of the ball. Suppose the ball takes t  seconds to come down. Now the initial  velocity of the ball is zero, u = 0. Distance  travelled by the ball on reaching the ground  = 4.05 m. As the velocity and acceleration   are in the same direction,  a = g=10 m/s According to Newton™s second equation of   motion 1 2 4.05 = 0 +       10 t 2       The ball will take 0.9 s to reach the  ground.

Assume g = 10 m/s 2 Given:  For the upward motion of the ball,  the final velocity of the ball   = v = 0  Distance travelled by the ball   = 4.05 m  acceleration a = - g = -10 m/s 2   Using Newton™s third equation of motion  v 2  = u 2  + 2 a s  0 = u 2  + 2 (-10) x 4.05    u 2  = 81    u = 9 m/s   The initialvelocityof the ball    is 9 m/s  Example 1.  An iron ball of mass 3 kg is   released from a height of 125 m and falls  freely to the ground. Assuming that the  value of g is 10 m/s 2 , calculate (i) time taken by the ball to reach the  ground (ii) velocity of the ball on reaching the  ground  (iii) the height of the ball at half the time it  takes to reach the ground. Given:  m = 3 kg, distance travelled by the  ball s = 125 m, initial velocity of the ball =  u = o and acceleration a = g = 10 m/s 2 . (i) Newton™s second equation of motion   gives  s = u t  +       a t 2 1 2  125 = 0 t +       x 10 x t 2  = 5 t 2   1 2 t 2  =         = 25  125    5 , t = 5 s   The ball takes 5 seconds to reach the  ground.  (ii) According to Newton™s first equation   of motion  final velocity = v = u + a t            = 0 + 10 x 5             = 50 m/s   The velocity of the ball on reachingthe   ground is 50 m/s  5 2 s = u t  +       a t 2 1  2 s =  0 +       10 x (2.5) 2    1  2  = 31.25 m. Thus the height of the ball at half time   = 125-31.25  = 93.75 m (iii) Half time  = t =      = 2.5 s Ball™s height at this time = s According to Newton™s second equation Solved Examples Use your brain power !   According to Newton™s law of gravitation,  earth™s  gravitational force is higher on an object of larger mass. Why doesn™t that object fall down with higher velocity  as compared to an object with lower mass? 13 Gravitational potential energy   We have studied potential energy in last standard. The energy stored in an object because  of its position or state is called potential energy. This energy is relative and increases as we  go to greater heights from the surface of the earth. We had assumed that the potential energy   of  an object of mass m, at a height h from the ground is mgh and on the ground it is zero.  When h is small compared to the radius R of the earth, we can assume g to be constant and   can use the above formula (mgh). But for large values of h, the value of g decreases with   increase in h. For an object at infinite distance from the earth, the value of g is zero and   earth™s gravitational force does not act on the object. So it is more appropriate to assume the   value of potential energy to be zero there. Thus, for smaller distances, i.e. heights, the potential   energy is less than zero, i.e. it is negative.  GMm  R+h     - u 2   2g       - Escape velocity   We have seen than when a ball is thrown upwards, its velocity decreases because of the  gravitation of the earth. The velocity becomes zero after reaching a certain height and after  that the ball starts falling down. Its maximum height depends on its initial velocity. According   to Newton™s third equation of motion is  v 2  = u 2 +2as, v = the final velocity of the ball  = 0 and a = - g    0 = u 2  + 2 (-g) s  and maximum height of the ball  = s =   Thus, higher the initial velocity u, the larger is the height reached by the ball.  The reason for this is that the higher the initial velocity, the ball will oppose the gravity of  the earth more and larger will be the height to which it can reach.  We have seen above that the value of g keeps decreasing as we go higher above the surface   of the earth. Thus, the force pulling the ball downward, decreases as the ball goes up.  If we   keep increasing the initial velocity of the ball, it will reach larger and larger heights and   above a particular value of initial velocity of the ball, the ball is able to overcome the   downward pull by the earth and can escape the earth forever and will not fall back on the   earth. This velocity is called escape velocity. We can determine its value by using the law of   conservation of energy as follows. An object  going vertically upwards from the surface of the earth, having an initial ve - locity equal to the escape velocity, escapes the gravitational force of the earth. The force of   gravity, being inversely proportional to the square of the distance, becomes zero only at in - finite distance from the earth. This means that for the object to be free from the gravity of the   earth, it has to reach infinite distance from the earth. i.e. the object will come to rest at in - finite distance and will stay there. on the surface of earth at infinite distance from the earth For an object of mass m 1 2 A.

GMm    8 = - 14 Weightlessness in space Space travellers as well as objects in the spacecraft appear to be floating. Why does this  happen? Though the spacecraft is at a height from the surface of the earth, the value of g   there is not zero. In the space station the value of g is only 11% less than its value on the   surface of the earth. Thus, the height of a spacecraft is not the reason for their weightlessness.    Their weightlessness is caused by their being in the state of free fall.  Though the spacecraft   is not falling on the earth because of its velocity along the orbit, the only force acting on it is   the gravitational force of the earth and therefore it is in a free fall. As the velocity of free fall   does not depend on the properties of an object, the velocity of free fall is the same for the   spacecraft, the travelers and the objects in the craft. Thus, if a traveller releases an object   from her hand, it will remain stationary with respect to her and will appear to be weightless.  Exercise 1.

Today 118 elements are known to the scientific world. However, around year  1800 only about 30 elements were known. More number of elements were discovered in   the course of time. More and more informationabout the properties of these elements was   gathered.To ease the study of such a large number of elements, scientists started studying   the pattern if any, in the vast information about them. You know that in the initial   classification elementswere classified into the groups of metals and nonmetals. Later  on   another class of elements called metalloids was noticed. As the knowledge about elements   and their properties went on increasing different scientists started trying out different   methods of classification. Dobereiner™s Triads   In the year 1817 a German scientist  Dobereiner suggested that properties of elements  are related to their atomic masses. He made groups of three elements each, having similar  chemical properties and called them triads. He arranged the three elementsin a triad in an   increasing order of atomic mass and showed that the atomic mass of the middle element   was approximately equal to the mean of the atomicmasses of the other two elements.  However, all the known elements could not be classified into the Dobereiner™s triads.   2.1 Dobereiner™s Triads Identify Dobereiner™s triads from the following groups of  elements having similar chemical properties. Can you recall? Can you tell? 1. Mg (24.3), Ca (40.1), Sr (87.6)          2. S (32.1), Se (79.0), Te (127.6)           3.

In the  year 1866 Newlands arranged the elements  known at that  time in an increasing order  of their atomic masses. It started with the  lightest element hydrogen and ended up   with thorium. He found that every eighth  element had propertiessimilarto those of  the first. For example,sodium is the eighth   element from lithium and both have similar  properties. Also, magnesium shows  similarity to beryllium and chlorine shows  similarity with fluorine. Newlands  compared this similarity with the octaves   in music. He called the similarity observed  in the eighth and the first element as the  Law of octaves. Musical  Note Do (Sa) Re (Re) Mi (Ga) Fa (Ma) So (Pa) La (Dha)  Ti (Ni) Elements H F Cl Co &Ni Br Li Na K Cu Rb Be Mg Ca Zn Sr B Al  Cr Y Ce & La C Si Ti In Zr N P Mn As O S Fe  Se 2.2 Newlands™ Octaves Many limitation were found in Newlands™ octaves. This law was found to be applicable  only up to calcium. Newlands fitted all the known elementsin a table of 7 X 8 that is 56  boxes. Newlands placed two elements each in some boxes to accommodate all the known  elements in the table. For example, Co and Ni, Ce and La. Moreover, he placed some  elements with different properties under the same note in the octave. For example,  Newlands placed the metals Co and Ni under the note ‚Do™ along with halogens, while Fe,   having similarity with Co and Ni, away from them along with the nonmetals O and S  under the note ‚Ti™. Also, Newlands™ octaves did not have provision to accommodate the  newly discovered elements. The properties of the new elements discovered later on did not   fit in the Newlands™ law of octaves.  In the Indian music system there  are seven main notes, namely, Sa, Re,  Ga, Ma, Pa, Dha, Ni, and their collection   is called ‚Saptak™. The frequency of the  notes goes on increasing from ‚Sa™ to  ‚Ni™. Then comes, the ‚Sa™ of the upper   ‚Saptak™ at the double the frequency of  the original ‚Sa™. It means that notes  repeat after completion of one ‚Saptak™.   The seven notes in the western music   are Do, Re, Mi, Fa, So, La, Ti. The note ‚Do™ having double the  original frequency comes again at the   eighth place. This is the octave of  western notes. Music is created by the  variety in the use of these notes. Newlands™ Law of Octaves Mendeleev™s Periodic table The Russian scientist Dmitri Mendeleev developedthe periodic table of elements   during the period 1869 to 1872 A.D. Mendeleev™s periodic table is the most important step  in the classification of elements. Mendeleev considered the fundamental property of  elements, namely, the atomic mass, as standard and arranged 63 elements  known at that  time in an increasing order of their atomic masses. Then he transformed this into the   periodictable of elements in accordance with the physical and chemical properties of  these elements.

He made separate card for every known  element showing its atomic mass. He arranged the cards in  accordance with the atomic masses and properties of the   elements which resulted in the inventionof the periodictable   of elements.      Dmitri Mendeleev   Mendeleev  organized the periodic table on the basis of the chemicaland physical  properties of the elements.These were the molecular formulae of hydrides and oxides of   the elements, melting points, boiling points and densities of the elements and their hydrides   and oxides. Mendeleev found that the elements with similar physical and chemical   properties repeat after a definite interval.  On the basis of this finding Mendeleev stated  the following periodic law.   Properties of elements are periodic function of their atomic masses.     The vertical columns in the Mendeleev™speriodic table are called groups while the  horizontal rows are called periods. (The general molecular formulae of compounds shown as R 2 O, R 2 O 3 , etc. in the upper  part of Mendeleev™s periodic table, are written as R 2 O, R 2 O 3 ,etc. in the present system.) 19 1.    There are some vacant places in the Mendeleev™s periodic table.  In some of these places the atomic masses are seen to be   predicted. Enlist three of these predicted atomic masses along   with their group and period. 2.  Due to uncertainty in the names of some of the elements, a  question mark is indicated before the symbol in the Mendeleev™s   periodic table. What are such symbols? Merits of Mendeleev™s periodic table  Science is progressive. There is a freedom in science to revise the old inference by  using more advanced means and methods of doing experiments. These characteristics of   science are clearly seen in the Mendeleev™s periodic table. Whileapplying the law that the properties of elements are a periodicfunction of their  atomic masses, to all the known elements, Mendeleev arranged the elements with a thought   that the information available till then was not final but it could change. As a result of this,   Mendeleev™s periodic table demonstrates the following merits.  1.    Atomic  masses of some elements were revised so as to give them proper place in the  periodic table in accordance with their properties. For example, the previously determined   atomic mass of beryllium, 14.09, was changed to the correct value 9.4, and beryllium was   placed before boron.  2.    Mendeleev  kept vacant places in the periodic table for elements not discovered till  then. Three of these unknown elements were given the names eka-boron, eka-aluminum   and    eka-silicon  from the known neighbours and their atomic masses were indicated as  44,    68 and 72, respectively.  Not only this but their properties were also predicted. Later  on these elements were discovered and named as scandium (Sc), gallium (Ga) and   germanium(Ge) respectively. The properties of these elements matchedwell with those   predicted by    Mendeleev.  See table 2.4. Due to this success all were convinced about the  importance of Mendeleev™s periodic table and this method of classification of elements   was accepted immediately.

There  was no placereserved for noble  gases in Mendeleev™s original periodic  table. However, when noble gases such   as helium, neon and argon were   discovered towards the end of   nineteenth century, Mendeleev created   the ‚ zero™ group without disturbing the   original periodic table in which the   noble gases were fitted very well.    Chlorine has two isotopes,viz, C1-35 and C1- 37. Their atomic masses are 35 and 37  respectively.  Their chemical properties are same. Where should   these be placed in Mendeleev™s periodic table? In   different places or in the same place? Think about it Use your brain power ! 20 Demerits of Mendeleev™s periodic table 1.   The whole number atomic  mass of the elements cobalt (Co) and nickel (Ni) is the same.  Therefore there was an ambiguity regarding their sequence in Mendeleev™s periodic  table.  2.   Isotopes were discovered long time  after Mendeleev put forth the periodic table. As  isotopes have the same chemical properties but different atomic masses, a challenge  was posed in placing them in Mendeleev™s periodic table.    3.    When  elementsare arranged in an increasing order of atomic masses, the rise in atomic  mass does not appear to be uniform. It was not possible, therefore, to predict how many   elements could be discovered between two heavy elements.

For   example, the molecular formula of  hydrogen is H 2  while the molecular  formulae of fluorine and chlorine are F 2  and Cl 2 , respectively.In the same way,  there is a similarity in the chemical   propertiesof hydrogen and alkalimetals  (group I). There is a similarity in the  molecular formulae of the compounds of  hydrogen alkali metals (Na, K, etc.)   formed with chlorineand oxygen. On  considering the above properties it can not  be decided whether the correct position of   hydrogen is in the group of alkali metals   Compounds of  H  Compounds of  Na HCl H 2 O H 2 S NaCl Na 2 O Na 2 S 2.5  Similarity in hydrogen and alkali metals 1.

Write   the molecular formulae of the compounds of the following elements with hydrogen  by referring to the Mendeleev™s periodic table.     C, S, Br, As, F, O, N, Cl Modern Periodic Law The scientific world did not know anything about the interior of the atom when  Mendeleev put forth the periodic table. After the discovery of electron, scientists started  exploring the relation between the electron number of an atom and the atomic number. The   atomic number in Mendeleev™s periodic table only indicated the serial number of the element. In 1913 A.D. the English scientist Henry Moseley demonstrated, with the help of the  experiments done using X-ray tube, that the atomic number (Z) of an elementcorresponds   to the positivecharge on the nucleus or the number of the protons in the nucleus of the atom   of that element. This revealed that ‚atomic number™ is a more fundamental property of an   element than its atomic mass. Accordingly the statement of the modern periodic law was   stated as follows:  Properties of elements are a periodic function of their atomic numbers. 2.6 : Similarity in hydrogen and halogens Use your brain power ! (group I) or in the group of halogens (group VII). 21 Modern periodic table : long form of the periodic table The classification of elements resulting from an arrangement of the elements in an  increasing order of their atomicnumbers is the modern periodictable. The properties of  elements can be predicted more accurately with the help of the modern periodic table  formed on the basis of atomic numbers. The modern periodic table is also called the long  form of the periodic table. In the modern periodic table the elements are arranged in accordancewith their atomic  number. (see table 2.7) As a result, most of the drawbacks of Mendeleev™s periodic table   appear to be removed.However, the ambiguity about the position of hydrogen is not   removed even in the modern periodic table. We have seen in the previous  standard that the electronic configuration   of an atom, the way in which the electron  are distributed in the shells around the  nucleus, is determined by the total  number of electrons in it; and the total  number of electrons in an atom is same   as the atomic number. The relation  between the atomic number of an element  and its electronic configuration is clearly  seen in the modern periodic table. Structure of the  Modern Periodic Table The modern periodic table contains  seven horizontal rows called the periods  1 to 7. Similarly, the eighteen vertical  columns in this table are the groups 1 to   18. The arrangementof the periods and  groups results into formation of boxes.  Atomic numbers are serially indicated in  the upper part of these boxes. Each box  corresponds to the place for one element.  Apart from these seven rows, two rows are shown separately at the bottom of the  periodic table. These are called lanthanide series and actinide series, respectively. There  are 118 boxes in the periodic table including the two series. It means that there are 118  places for elements in the modern periodic table. Very recently formation of a few elements  was established experimentally and thereby the modern periodic table is now  completely  filled. All the 118 elements are now discovered. The entire periodic table is divided into four blocks,viz, s-block, p-block, d-block and  f-block. The s-block contains the groups 1 and 2. The groups 13 to 18 constitutethe p-block.  The groups 3 to 12 constitute the d-block, while the lanthanide and actinide series at the  bottom form the f-block. The d-block elements are called transition elements. A zig-zag   line can be drawn in the p-block of the periodictable. The three traditional types of  elements can be clearlyshown in the modern periodic table with the help of this zig-zag  line. The metalloid elements lie along the border of this zig-zag line. All the metals lie on  the left side of the zig-zag line while all the nonmetals lie on the right side.

How is the problem regarding the  position of cobalt ( 59 Co) and nickel  ( 59 Ni) in Mendeleev™s periodic table  resolved in modern periodic table? 2.    How did the position of  17 Cl and   17 C1  get fixed in the modern periodic ta - ble?  3.

Should hydrogen  be placed in the group 17 of halogens   or group 1 of alkali metals in the   modern periodic table?  Use your brain power ! 37 35 52 55 22 Modern periodic Table and electronic  Configuration of Elements Within a period the neighbouring elements  differ slightly in their properties while distant  elements differ widely in their properties.  Elements in the same group show similarity   and gradation in their properties. These  characteristics of the groups and periods in the  modern periodic table are because of the   electronicconfiguration of the elements. It is  the electronic configurationof an element  which decides the group and the period in which  it is to be placed. Groups and electronic configuration You will find that the number of valence electrons in all these elements from the  group 1, that is, the family of alkalimetals,is the same. Similarly, if you look at the  elements from any other group, you will find the number of their valence electrons to be   the same. For example, the elements beryllium (Be), magnesium (Mg) and calcium (Ca)  belong to the group 2, that is, the family of alkaline earth metals. There are two electrons  in their outermost shell. Similarly, there are seven electronsin the outermost shell of the  elements such as fluorine(F) and chlorine (Cl) from the group 17, that is, the family of  halogens. While going from top to bottom within any group, one electronic shell gets   added at a time. From this we can say that the electronic configuration of the outermost  shell is characteristicof a particular group. However, as we go down a group, the number  of  shells goes on increasing.  1. Go through the modern periodic table (table no. 2.7) and write  the names one below the other of the elements of group 1. 2. Write the electronic configuration of the first  four elements in  this group. 3. Which similarity do you find in their configuration? 4. How many valence electrons are therein each of these elements?  Characteristics of Groups and  Periods   The characteristics of the groups  and periods in the periodic table are  understood by comparison of the  propertiesof the elements. Various  properties of all the elements in a  group show similarity and gradation.   However, the properties of elements  change slowly while going from one  end to the other (for example, from   left to right) in a particular period. In the modern periodic table....... 1.    Elements  are arranged in an increasing order  of their atomic numbers. 2. Vertical columns are called groups. There are  18 groups. The chemical properties of the  elements in the same group show similarity  and gradation. 3.    Horizontal  rows are called periods. There are  in all 7 periods. The properties of elements   change slowly from one end to the other in a  period. Can you tell?     Uranium  has atomic  number 92. All the elements  beyond uranium (with atomic   numbers 93 to 118) are   manmade.All these elements   are radioactive and unstable,   and have a very short life.  Do you know ? 23 1. On going through the modern periodictable it is seen that the  elements Li, Be, B, C, N, O, F and Ne belong to the period-2.  Write down electronic configuration of all of them. 2. Is the number of valenceelectrons same for all these elements? 3. Is the number of shells the same in these ? You will find that  the number of valence  electrons is different in   these elements.  However, the number  of shells is the same.  You will also find that,  while going from left to   right, withinthe period,  the atomic number  increases by one at a  time and the number of  valence electrons also   increases by one at a  time. 2.8  New period new shell Argon atom Be 2,2 Mg 2,8,2 Ca 2,8,8,2 Sr Ba  Ra H 1 Li 2,1 Na 2,8,1 K 2,8,8,1 B  2,3 C  2,4 N  2,5 O  2,6 F  2,7 Al  2,8,3 Si  2,8,4 P  2,8,5 S  2,8,6 Cl  2,8,7 He 2 Ne 2,8 Ar 2,8,8 1 2  3  4  5  6  7      1            2              13          14          15         16         17         18 Potassium atom Can you tell? 2.7   Table : Modern Periodic Table Periods and electronic configuration d- block Atomic No. Symbol  Name Atomic mass s- block p- block f- block # * 24 We can say that the elements with the same number of shells occupied by electrons  belong to the same period. The elements in the second period, namely, Li, Be, B, C, N, O, F  and Ne have electrons in the two shells, K and L. The elements in the third period, namely,  Na, Mg, Al, Si, P, S, Cl and Ar have electrons in the three shells; K, L and M. Write down  the electronic configuration of these elements and confirm. In the modern periodic table,   electrons are filled in the same shell while going along a period from left to right, and at the   beginning of the next period a new electron shell starts filling up (See the table 2.8). The number of elements in the first three periods is determined by the electron capacity  of the shells and the law of electron octet. (See the Table 2.9) 1.    What are the values of ‚n™ for the shells K, L and M? 2.    What is the maximum number of electrons that can be   accommodated in a shell? Write the formula. 3.  Deduce the maximum electron capacity of the shells K, L and M. As per the electron holding capacity of  shells 2 elements are present in the first period  and 8 elements in the second period. The third   period also contains only eight elements due to   the law of electron octet. There are few more   factors which control the filling of electrons in   the subsequent periods which will be considered   in the next standards. 1. What is the relationship between the electronic configuration  of an element and its valency? 2.  The atomic number of beryllium is 4 while that of oxygen is 8.  Write down the electronic configuration of the two and deduce  their valency from the same. The chemical reactivity of an element is determined by the number of valence electrons  in it and the shell number of the valence shell. The information on these points is obtained  from the position of the element in the periodic table. That is, the modern periodic table has  proved useful for study of elements. Periodic trends in the modern periodic table When the properties of elements in a period or a group of the modern periodic table are  compared, certain regularity is observed in th eir variations. It is called the periodic trends in  the modern periodic table. In this standard we are going to consider the periodic trends in  only three properties of elements; namely, valency, atomic size and metallic- nonmetallic   character.  Valency :  You have learnt in the previous standard that the valency of an element is  determined by the number of electrons present in the outermost shell of its atoms, that is, the   valence electrons. 3. The table on the next page is made on the basis of the modern periodic table. Write in it the  electronic configuration of the first 20 elements below the symbol, and write the valency  (as shown in a separate box).  4. What is the periodic trend in the variation of valency while going from left to right within  a period? Explain your answer with reference to period 2 and period 3. 5. What is the periodic trend in the variation of valency while going down a group? Explain  your answer with reference to the group 1, group 2 and group 18. Can you recall ?

By referring to the modern periodic table find out the  groups to which above the elements belong. 2. Arrange the above elements vertically downwards in an increasing order of atomic radii. 3. Does this arrangement match with the pattern of the group 1 of the modern periodic  table? 4. Which of the above elements have the biggest and the smallest atom? 5. What is the periodic trend observed in the variation of atomic radii down a group? You will find that while going down a group the atomic size goes on increasing. This is  because while going down a group a new shell is added. Therefore the distance between the   outermost electron and the nucleus goes on increasing. As a result of this the atomic size  increases in spite of the increased nuclear charge. Atomic size You have seen in the previous  standards that size/volume is a fundamental  property of matter. The size of an atom is    Y ou will find that atomicradius  goes on decreasing while going from   left to right within a period. The  reason behind this is as follows.  Whilegoing from left to right within  a period, the atomic number  increases one by one, meaning the   positive charge on the nucleus  increases by one unit at a time.  However, the additional electron   gets added to the same outermost  shell. Due to the increased nuclear  charge the electrons are pulled  towards  the nucleus to a greater  extent and thereby the size of the   atom decreases.   Atomic  radius is expressed in the unit picometer (pm) which is smaller than nanometer  1 18 1 2 3 4  2         13       14       15       16       17 Symbol Electronic configuration Valency 19 K 2, 8, 8, 1 1 Element               :   O     B     C        N    Be        Li Atomic radius (pm) :    66   88     77       74   111   152 Element                   :   K         Na     Rb     Cs         Li Atomic radius (pm):     231      186    244    262       152 1.

Some elementsand their atomic   radii are given here. 26 Metallic- Nonmetallic Character 1. Look at the elements of the third period. Classify them  into metals and nonmetals. 2. On which side of the period are the metals? Left or right? 3. On which side of the period  did you find the nonmetals? It is seen that the metallic elements like sodium, magnesium are towards the left. The  nonmetallic elements such as sulphur, chlorine are towards the right. The metalloid element  silicon lies in between these two types. A similar pattern is also observed in the other periods.   It is seen that the zig- zag line separates the metals from nonmetals  in the periodic table.  Elements appear to have arranged in such a way that metals are on left side of this line,   nonmetals on the right side and metalloids are along the border of this line. How did this   happen?   Let  us compare the characteristic chemical properties of metals and nonmetals. It is  seen from the chemical formulae of simple ionic compounds that the cation in themis   formed from a metal while the anion from a nonmetal. From this it is understood that metal   atoms have a tendency to form a cation by losing its valence electron, this property is called   electropositivity of an element. On the other hand an atom of a nonmetal has a tendency to   form an anion by accepting electronsfrom outside into its valenceshell. We have already   seen that ions have a stable electronic configuration of a noble gas. How is the ability to lose   or accept electrons in the valence shell determined? All the electrons in any atom are held   by the attractive force exerted on them by the positivelycharged nucleus. Electronsin the   inner shells lie in between the valence shell and the nucleus. Because of their presence the  effectivenuclear charge exerting an attractive force on the valence electrons is somewhat  less than the actual nuclear charge. Thus, the number of valence electrons in metals is small   (1 to 3). Also the effective nuclear charge exerting attractive force on the valence electrons   is small. As a combinedeffect of these two factors metals have a tendency to lose the   valence electrons to form cations having a stable noble gas configuration. This tendency of   an element called electropositivity is the metallic character of that element.

What is the expecte d trend in the  variation of nonmetallic character of  elements from left to right in a period? 3.   What would be the expected  trend in  the variation of nonmetallic character  of elements down a group?     The periodic trend in the metallic character of elements is clearly understood from  their position is the modern periodic table. Let us first consider the metallic character of  elements belonging to the same group. Whilegoing down a group a new shell gets added,  resultingin an increasein the distancebetween the nucleus and the valence electrons. This   results  in lowering the effective nuclear charge and thereby lowering the attractive force  on the valenceelectrons. As a result of this the tendencyof the atom to lose electrons  increases. Also the penultimate shell becomes the outermost shell on losing valence   electrons. The penultimate shell is a complete octet. Therefore, the resulting cation has a   special stability. Due to this, the tendency of the atom to lose electrons increases further.  The metallic character of an atom is its tendency to lose electrons. Therefore, the following  trend is observed : The metallic character of elements increases while going down the   group.    While  going from left to right within a period the outermost shell remains the same.  However, the positive charge on the nucleus goes on increasingwhile the atomic radius   goes on decreasing and thus the effective nuclear charge goes on increasing. As a result of  this the tendency of atom to lose valence electrons decreases within a period from left to  right (See Table 2.10). The two factors namely, the increasing nuclear charge and decreasing atomic radius  as we go from left to right within a period, are responsible for increasing the effective   nuclearcharge. Therefore, the valence electrons are held with greaterand greaterattractive  force. This is called electronegativity of an atom. Due to increasing electronegativity from  leftto right within a period, the ability of an atom to become anion by accepting outside   electrons goes on increasing. The tendency of an element to form anion or the electro   negativity is the nonmetallic character of an element. 1.   While  going downwards in any group the  electropositivity of elements goes on increasing  while their electronegativity goes on decreasing. 2.   While  going from left to right in any period the  electronegativityof elements goes on increasing   while their electropositivity goes on decreasing. 3.   Larger the electropositivity  or electronegativity  of the element higher the reactivity. Always remember Use your brain power ! Gradation in Halogen Family The group 17 contains the members of the halogen family. All of them have the  general formula X 2 . A gradation is observed in their physical state down the group.

The atoms  attain a complete octet by giving, taking or sharing of electrons with each other. Chemical Reaction Some of the scientists of the 18 th  and 19 th  century carried out fundamental experiments  on chemical reactions. They proved from their experiments that  during chemical reactions  composition of the matter changes and that change remains permanent. On the contrary  during physical change only the state of matter changes and this change is often  temporary  in nature. Identify physical and chemical changes from the phenomena given in the following table. 3.1 Some common phenomenon Note :    Do the following activities in a group of friends.

Read and record the temperatures  in the activities 2 to 4.  Can you recall? Try this. 31 A physical change takes place due to change in the parameters such as temperature,  pressure. Often a physical change in reversible.The compositionof matterremains the  same in a physical change. For example, ice is transformed into water on heatingand  water is transformed into ice on cooling. On the contrary, if the compositionof matter  changes during a process then it is calleda chemical change. When we call a particular  process or phenomenon as a chemical change, some chemical reactions are taking place  in the concerned matter.  A chemical reactionis a process in which some substances undergo bond breaking  and are transformed into new substances by formation of new bonds. The substances   taking part in chemical reaction are called reactants, whereas the substances formed as a   result of a chemicalreaction by formation of new bonds are called products. For example,  formation of carbon dioxide gas by combustion of coal in air is a chemical reaction. In  this reaction coal (carbon) and oxygen (from air) are the reactants while carbon dioxide  is the product. A chemical reaction is represented by writing a chemical equation.

In the activity 2, a colourless solution of zinc  sulphate (ZnSO 4 ) is formed on addition of zinc dust to the blue solution of copper sulphate  (CuSO 4 ). This chemical reaction can be written in brief as follows. Aqueous solution of  copper sulphate + zinc dust  Aqueous solution of zinc                      sulphate + copper .......... (1)   This simple way of representing a chemical reaction in words is called a ‚Word Equation™.    A  word equation can be written in a further condensed form  by using chemical formulae  as follows.      CuSO 4  + Zn      ZnSO 4   + Cu.................(2)   The representation  of a chemicalreaction in a condensed form using chemical formulae  is calledas the chemical equation. In the above equation copper sulphate (CuSO 4 ) and zinc  (Zn) are the reactants. They react with each other to form copper particles (Cu) and a  solution of the colourless zinc sulphate (ZnSO 4 ) as the products having totally different  properties. The ionic bond in the reactant CuSO 4  breaks and the ionic bond in the product  ZnSO 4  is formed during the reaction. Writing a Chemical Equation Let us now see the conventions followed while writing a chemical equation. 1.   In a chem ical equation the reactants are written on the left hand side while the  products on the right hand  side. An arrow heading towards the products is drawn in between  them. This arrow indicates the direction of the reaction. 2.   If the  reactants or products are two or more, they are linked with a plus sign (+) in  between them. For example, in the equation (2) a plus sign (+) is drawn in between the   reactants CuSO 4  and Zn. Similarly, a plus sign (+) is drawn in between the products ZnSO 4   and Cu. 3.   To  make the chemical equationmore informative the physical states of the reactants  are indicated in the equation.Theirgaseous, liquidand solid states are indicated by  writing   the letters (g), (l) and (s), respectively in the brackets. Moreover, if the product is gaseous,   instead of (g) it can be indicated by an arrow   pointing upwards. If the product formed is  insoluble solid, in the form of a precipitate, then instead of (s) it can be indicated by an   arrow   pointing downwards. When reactants and products are in the form of solution in  water, they are said to be present in aqueous solution state. This state is indicated by putting   the letters aq in brackets after their formula. Thus, the equation (2) is rewritten as equation   (3) shown below. CuSO 4  (aq) + Zn (s)   ZnSO 4  (aq) + Cu (s) ..................... (3) 4.   When heat is to be given from outside to bring about a reaction,  it is indicated by the  sign  written above the arrow that indicates the direction of the reaction. For example, the  reaction in which slaked lime is formed on heating lime stone is written as follows.          CaCO 3  (s)      CaO (s) + CO 2    ........................ (4) Similarly, the fact that heat is released during the reaction between the aqueous solution  of copper sulphate and zinc dust is indicated as follows. CuSO 4  (aq) + Zn (s)   ZnSO 4  (aq) + Cu (s) + Heat ..................... (5) 5. It is necessary to fulfill certain conditions like specific temperature,pressure, catalyst,  etc. to bring about some reactions. These conditions are indicated below or above the arrow   indicating the direction of the reaction. For example, the reaction of a vegetable oil takes   place at the temperature of 60  0 C with hydrogen gas in presence of the Ni catalyst and is  written as follows. 33 Apparatus:  Test tube, conical flask, balance, etc. Chemicals :  Sodium chloride and silver nitrate. Silver nitrate is used in the voters-ink.  Procedure : 1. Take sodium chloride solution in a conical flask and silver nitrate solution in a test tube. 2. Tie a thread to the test tube and insert it carefully into the conical flask. Make the   conical flask air tight by fitting a rubber cork. 3.  Weigh the conical flask with the help of a balance.  4.  Now tilt the conical flask and mix the solution present in the test tube with the solution  in the conical flask. 5.  Weigh the conical flask again.   Which changes did you find? Did any  insoluble substance form? Was there any  change in the weight?  A word equation is written for the above activity as shown below.   Silver nitrate + Sodium chloride       Silver chloride + Sodium nitrate The above word equation is represented by the following chemical equation.

(9)                            (white) 34 Balancing a Chemical Equation Complete the table aside on the  basis of the equation (9). It is seen that the number of atoms  of the elements in the reactants in this  equation is same as the number of   atoms of those elements in the products.  Such an equation is called a ‚balanced  equation™. If the number of atoms of  each element is not the same on the two  sides of an equation, it is called an   ‚unbalanced equation™.

This is in accordance with the  law of  conservation of mass that you studied in the previous standard. Steps in balancing a chemical reaction  A chemicalequation is balanced step by step. A trial and error method is used for this  purpose. Consider the following equation as an example :  Sodium hydroxide + Sulphuric acid   Sodium sulphate + water.  STEP I. Write the chemical equation from the given word equation.  NaOH + H 2 SO 4     Na 2 SO 4 + H 2 O ..............(10) STEP III : It is convenient to start balancing an equation from the compound which  contains the maximum number of atoms. Moreover it is convenient to first consider that  element in this compound, which has unequal number of atoms on the two sides.  Reactants  (Left side) Products  (Right side) Element Number of atoms Number of atoms Na 1 2 O 5 5 H 3 2 S 1 1 Number of  sodium  atoms In the  Reactants  (in NaOH) In the  Products   (in Na 2 SO 4 ) Initially 1 2 To balance 1 x 2 2 Always remember STEP II. Check whether the  equation (10) is balanced or not by  comparing the  number of atoms of  the various elements present on the  two sides of the equation.  It is seen that the number of  atoms of all the elements on the two  sides are not the same. It means that  the equation (10) is not balanced. (i) In the equation(10), thereare two  components Na 2 SO 4  and H 2 SO 4 , which contain  the maximum number that is seven atoms each.  Any one of them can be selected.Select the  compound Na 2 SO 4 . Further select sodium for  balancingas the number of atoms of  sodium  in this compound is unequal on the two sides. It  should be remembered that, the formula of a compound cannot be changed while balancing  the number of atoms. It means that, here to make the number of sodium atoms in the  reactants as ‚2™ the formula NaOH cannot be changed to Na 2 OH. Instead a factor of ‚2™  will have to be applied to NaOH. Write down the resulting equation (10) /   on doing this. 35   2NaOH + H 2 SO 4     Na 2 SO 4 + H 2 O ..............(10) / (ii) Check whether the equation (10) /  is balanced or not.   We find that the equation  (10) /   is not balanced, as the number of oxygen and  hydrogen atoms are unequal on the two sides. First balance the hydrogen number as it  requires a smaller factor. (iii) Apply a factor ‚2™ to the product ‚H 2 O™ for  balancing the equation (10) ™ Now write down the resulting equation (10) // .  1. (a) Identify the reactants and products of equation (6).

Step IV : Write down the final balanced  equation again. 2NaOH + H 2 SO 4     Na 2 SO 4 + 2H 2 O ....(11)  In this way, a balanced equation is obtained  from an unbalanced equation by applying proper  factors to appropriate reactant/product so as to  balance the number of each element in steps.

During this some chemical bonds in the reactants break and some new  chemical bonds are formed  so as to transform the reactants into the products. In this  chapter we will be studying the types of reactions in detail.  Types of chemical reactions   Chemical  reactions are classified into the following four types in accordance  with the nature and the number of the reactants and the products. 1. Combination reaction   Try this. 36 Activity 1 : Take a small amount of hydrochloric acid in a test tube. Heat the test tube. Dip  a glass rod in the ammonia solution and hold on the top of the test tube. You will observe   a white smoke emanating from the tip of the glass rod.    What must have happened?  Due to heating HCl vapours started coming out from the test tube, and NH 3  gas came  out from the solution on the glass rod. The ammonia gas and hydrogen chloridegas reacted   to form the salt ammonium chloride in gaseous state first, but immediately due to the   condensation process at room temperature it got transformed into the solid state. As a   result white smoke was formed. The chemical equation  for this is as follows.                  NH 3  (g)+ HCl (g)    NH 4 Cl(s) ...........................

(13) In this reaction magnesium oxide is formed as the single product by combination of  magnesium and oxygen.  Activity 3:  Take water in a beaker up to half of its capacity. Add a few piecesof slaked  lime (calcium oxide, CaO) to it. Calcium hydroxide (Ca (OH) 2 ) is formed by combination  of calcium oxide and water with generation of large amount of heat.

After some time you will see the formation of a burnt out black substance. Exactly  what must have happened in this activity? In the above activity a single reactant sugar is divided into two substances (C and  H 2 O)                 C 12 H 22 O 11    12 C   +    11H 2 O............................. (15)                    Sugar              carbon The  reaction in which there is only one reactant giving rise to two or more products is  called a decomposition reaction. Use your brain power! Try this.   When two or more reactants combine in a reaction to form a single product, it  is a combination reaction.  2. Decomposition reaction Heat 37 Apparatus :  Two test tubes, bent tube, rubber cork, burner, etc. Chemicals :  Calcium carbonate, freshly  prepared lime water. Procedure :  Take some calcium carbonate  in  a test tube. Fit a bent tube to this test   tube with the help of a rubber cork. Insert   the other end of the bent tube in the freshly   prepared lime water taken in the other test   tube. Heat the powdered calcium carbonate   in the first test tube strongly. The lime   water will turn milky.  We saw in the above activity that calcium carbonate undergoes decomposition  reactionand the carbon dioxide gas formed turns the lime water milky (Eq. 16). The   second product of the reaction,the calciumoxide powder, remains behind in the first test   tube. Similarly, in another reaction (Eq. 17) hydrogen peroxidenaturallyundergoes slow   decomposition into water and oxygen. CaCO 3 (s)                   CaO(s) + CO 2    ..... (16) 2H 2 O 2 (l)   2H 2 O(l) + O 2     .... (17) (16) and (17) both are decomposition reactions. Is it possible to produce hydrogen by decomposition of water  by means of heat, electricity or light ? Many degradation processes take place in the nature surrounding us. Organic  waste is decomposed by microorganisms and as a result manure and biogas are formed.  Biogas is used as a fuel.   Try this.      3.6 Decomposition of calcium carbonate  Lime   water Heating Calcium   carbonate Can you recall? We have studied in the previous standard that water decomposes into hydrogen and  oxygen gases on passing electric current through acidulated water. This decomposition  takes place by means of  electrical energy. Therefore it is called electrolysis.                                         2H 2 O(l)       2H 2    + O 2    ......(18)    The chemical reaction in which two or more products are formed from a single  reactant is a ‚‚Decomposition reactionﬂ. Electrical Energy 38 3. Displacement reaction We saw in the beginning of this chapter that on adding zinc dust to blue coloured  copper sulphate solution, a colourless solution of zincsulphate is formed and heat is  generated. See the equation (3) for this reaction. From that we learnt that the Zn 2+  ions formed from Zn atoms take the placeof  Cu 2+   ions in copper sulphate, and Cu atoms, formed from Cu 2+ ion come out. It means that Zn  displaces Cu from CuSO 4 .  The reaction in which the place of the ion of a less reactive element in a compound  is taken by another more reactive element by formation of its own ions, is called   displacement reaction.  (We will learn about reactivity of elementsin the chapter on metallurgy.)The elements  iron and lead, similar to zinc, displace copper from its compound.  Complete the following reactions and give names of the   products.  1. CuSO 4 (aq) + Fe (s)     ...........  +  .............  2. CuSO 4 (aq) + Pb(s)      ...........  +  .............  4. Double displacement reaction We have seen in the equation (9) that a white precipitate of silver chloride is formed  by an exchange of silver and sodium ions present in the reactants. The reaction in which the ions in the reactants are exchanged to form a precipitate  is a double displacement reaction.   Recall the activity  (3) in which you added potassium chromate (K 2 CrO 4 ) into the  solution of barium sulphate (BaSO 4 ). 1. What was the colour of the precipitate formed ? 2. Write the name of the precipitate.  3. Write down the balanced equation for this reaction. 4. Will you call this reaction a displacement reaction or a double displacement reaction. Endothermic and Exothermic Processes and Reaction : Heat is absorbed and given away in various processes and reactions. Accordingly  processes and reactions are classified as ‚Endothermic or Exothermic™. Endothermic and Exothermic Processes    Heat  from outside is absorbed during some physical changes. For example,  (i) melting of ice (ii) dissolution of potassium nitrate in water. Therefore, these are  ‚Endothermic processes.™   On  the other hand, heat is given away during some physical changes. For example,  (i) formation of ice from water, (ii) dissolution of sodium hydroxide in water. Therefore   these are  ‚Exothermic processes.™  In the process of dilution of concentrated sulphuric   acid with water, very large amount of heat is liberated. As a result, water gets evaporated   instantaneously,if it is poured in to the concentrated sulphuric acid, which may cause an   accident. To avoid this, required amount of water is taken in a glass container and small   quantity of concentrated sulphuric acid at a timeis added with stirring. Therefore, only a   small amount of heat is liberated at a time. Use your brain power ! 39 Try this. To carry out endothermic and exothermic processes Apparatus :  Two plastic bottles, measuring cylinder, thermometer etc. Chemicals :  Potassium nitrate, sodium hydroxide, water etc. (Sodium hydroxide being corrosive, handle it carefully in presence of  Teacher.) Use your brain power ! 1. What is the difference in the process of dissolution  and a chemical reaction ? 2. Does a new substance form when a solute dissolves  in a solvent ? Rate of Chemical Reaction  Can you tell? Take into account the time required for following processes.  Classify them into two groups and give titles to the groups. 1. Cooking gas starts burning on ignition . 2. Iron article undergoes rusting.  3. Erosion of rocks takes place to form soil.  4. Alcohol is formed on mixing yeast in glucose solution under proper condition.  5. Effervescence is formed on adding baking soda into a test tube containing dilute acid.  6. A white precipitate is formed on adding dilute sulphuric acid to barium chloride solution.  It can be seen from the above examples that some reactions are completed in short  time, that is, occur rapidly, while some other require long time for completion, that is,   occur slowly. It means that the rate of different reactions is different. Procedure  :  Take 100 ml water in each of the two plastic bottles. Plastic being insulator of  heat, the dissipation of heat can be prevented. Note the temperature of water in the bottles.  Put 5 g potassium nitrate   (KNO 3 )  in the bottle and shake well. Note the temperature of  the solution formed. Put 5 g sodium hydroxide (NaOH) in the other bottle. Shake the bottle   well. Note the temperature. In the first bottlethe process of dissolution of potassium nitratetook place while in  the second bottlethe process of dissolution of sodium hydroxide took place.As per your   observation which one is exothermic process and which is an endothermic process? During the process of the dissolution of KNO 3  in water, heat from the surroundings  is absorbed and therefore the temperature of the resulting solution is less. The process in   which heat is absorbed from the outside, is called endothermic process. When the solid   NaOH is dissolved in water heat is given out, and therefore the temperature increases. The   processes in which heat is given out are called exothermic processes.  Endothermic and Exothermic Reactions There is an exchange of heat in chemicalreactions as well. Accordingly some chemical  reactions are exothermic while some other are endothermic.During exothermicchemical   reactions heat is given away when reactants are transformed into the products, while   during endothermic chemicalreactions heat is either absorbed from the surroundings or   has to be supplied continuously from outside. For example,   CaCO 3  (s) + heat   CaO (s) + CO 2 (g)   ( Endothermic Reaction )   CaO (s) + H 2 O ( l )  Ca(OH) 2  (aq) + heat   ( Exothermic Reaction ) 40   The same reaction occurs at a different rate on changing the conditions. For  example,during winter long timeis required for setting milk into curd, while at the higher  temperature during summer, the rate of setting of milk increases and the curd is formed  early. Now let us see the factors which decide the rate of a chemical reaction. Factors affecting the rate of a chemical reaction  a. Nature of the Reactants Let us see the reaction of the metals aluminium (Al) and zinc (Zn) with dilute  hydrochloric acid. On reaction of both Al and Zn with dilute hydrochloric acid H 2  gas is liberatedand  water soluble salts of these metals are formed. However, the reaction of aluminium metal  takes place faster as compared to zinc metal.  The nature of the metal is responsible for  this difference. Al is more reactive than Zn. Therefore the rate of reaction of Al with  hydrochloric acid is higher than that of Zn. Nature or reactivity of reactants influences the  rate of a chemical reaction. (We are going to learn more about the reactivity of metals in   the chapter on Metallurgy.)  b. Size of the Particles of Reactants Try this. Apparatus : Two test tubes, balance, measuring cylinder, etc. Chemicals:  Pieces of Shahabad tile, powder of Shahabad tile, dilute  HCl etc. Procedure  :  Take pieces and powder of Shahabad tile in equal weights in two test tubes.  Add 10 ml dilute HCl in each of the test tubes. Observe whether effervescenceof CO 2  is  formed at a faster or slower speed. You must have found in the above activity that the CO 2  effervescence is formed slowly  with the pieces of Shahabad tile while at a faster speed with the powder. The above observation indicates that the rate of a reaction depends upon the size of  the particles of the reactants taking part in the reaction. Smaller the size of the reactant   particles, higher is the rate of the reaction. c. Concentration of the reactants Let us consider the reaction of dilute and concentrated hydrochloric acid with CaCO 3   powder. Dilute HCl reacts slowly with CaCO 3  and thereby CaCO 3  disappears slowly and CO 2   also liberates slowly. On the other hand the reaction with concentrated HCl takes place  rapidly and CaCO 3  disappears fast. Concentrated acid reacts faster than dilute acid, which means that rate of a reaction  is proportional to the concentration of reactants. d. Temperature of the Reaction        While studying decomposition reaction, you have carried out decomposition of lime  stone. In this activity, the lime water does not turn milkybefore heatingthe lime stone;    because of the zero rate of reaction. From this it is learnt that the rate of a reaction increases   on increasing the temperature. 41 e. Catalyst On heating potassium chlorate (KClO 3 )  decomposes slowly.    2KClO 3    2KCl + 3O 2  ....... (19) The rate of the above reaction neither increases by reducing the particlesize nor by  increasing the reactiontemperature. However, KClO 3  decomposes rapidly in presence of  manganese dioxide (MnO 2 ) to liberate O 2  gas. No chemical change takes place in MnO 2   in this reaction. ﬁThe substance in whose presence the rate of a chemical reaction increases,  without causing any chemical change to it, is called a catalyst.ﬂ The decomposition of hydrogen peroxide into water and oxygen takes place slowly at  room temperature (Eq. 17). However, the same reaction occurs at a faster rate on adding  manganese dioxide (MnO 2 ) powder in it.   1. One or more chemical reactions take place during every chemical change. 2. Some chemical reactions occur at fast speed whereas some occur at slow speed.  3. Strong acid and strong base react instantaneously.  4. In our body, enzymes increase the rate of physiological reactions.  5.  Perishable foodstuff gets preserved longer in a refrigerator. The rate of decomposition  of foodstuff gets lowered due to low temperature, and its freshness is maintained. 6. Vegetables cook quickly on oil rather than on water.  7. The chemical reactions  are profitable in the chemical factories if their rate is fast.  8. The rate of chemical reaction is important from environmental point of view as  well. 9. The ozone layer in the earth™s atmosphere protects the life on earth from the  ultraviolet radiation of the sun. The process of depletion or maintenance of this  layer  depends upon the rate of production or destruction of ozone molecules.  Oxidation and Reduction Many types of substances give reactions called oxidation and reduction. Let us learn  more about these reaction.   The  chemical reaction in which a reactant combines with oxygen or loses hydrogen  to form the product is called oxidation reaction.  2Mg  +  O 2    2MgO ..........(20) C   +  O 2            CO 2      ..........(21) MgH 2             Mg + H 2     .......(22) CH 3 - CH 3         CH 2 = CH 2   + H 2   ...(23)   In the reactions (20) and (21) a  reactant  combines with oxygen, whereas  in (22) and (23) hydrogen gas is removed  from the reactant. All these are examples   of the oxidation reaction. Do you know ? 42 Some oxidation reactions are brought about by use of specific chemical substances. For example,   [O] CH 3  - CH 2 - OH                                                                      CH 3  - COOH ........ (24) Here the acidic potassium dichromate makes oxygen available for the oxidation of  the reactant ethyl alcohol. Such chemical substances which bring about an oxidation  reaction by making oxygen available are called oxidants or oxidizing agents. A variety of oxidants are used to bring about a controlled oxidation. K 2 Cr 2 O 7 /H 2 SO 4 , KMnO 4 /H 2 SO 4  are the commonly used chemical oxidants. Hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ) is used as a mild oxidant. Ozone (O 3 ) is also a chemical  oxidant. Nascent oxygen is generated by chemicaloxidants and it is used for the  oxidation reaction. O 3   O 2  + [O] H 2 O 2  H 2 O + [O] K 2 Cr 2 O 7   + 4H 2 SO 4 K 2 SO 4  + Cr 2  (SO 4 ) 3  +4H 2 O + 3 [O] 2KMnO 4  + 3H 2 SO 4  K 2 SO 4  + 2MnSO 4  + 3H 2 O + 5 [O] Nascent oxygen is a state prior to the formation of the O 2  molecule. It is the  reactive form of oxygen and is represented by writing the symbol as [O]. 1. Which is the oxidant used for purification of drinking  water? 2. Why is potassium permanganate used during  cleaning water tanks? We have seen just now that potassium permanganate is a chemical oxidant. Now  have a look at the following reaction.     2KMnO 4  + 10FeSO 4  + 8H 2 SO 4    K 2 SO 4  + 2MnSO 4  + 5Fe 2 (SO 4 ) 3  + 8H 2 O ........ (25) Which compound is oxidised by KMnO 4  in presence of acid in this reaction? Of  course FeSO 4 . Here FeSO 4  is transformed into Fe 2 (SO 4 ) 3 . Let us now see, how this conversion is an  oxidation reaction.       2FeSO 4    Fe 2 (SO 4 ) 3                      Ionic reaction             Fe 2+  + SO 4 2-    2Fe 3+  + 3SO 4 2-   The net change taking place in the above conversion is shown by the net ionic  reaction as shown below.                  Net ionic reaction          Fe 2+     Fe 3+                               (Ferrous)     (Ferric)   This net ionic reaction represents the oxidation brought about by KMnO 4 .  When ferric ion is formed from ferrous ion the positive charge is increased by one unit.  While this  happens the ferrous ion loses one electron. From this, we understand a new   defination of oxidation, which is ﬁoxidation means losing one or more electrons.ﬂ Use your brain power !  Ethyl alcohol           K 2 Cr 2 O 7 /H 2 SO 4                 Acetic acid Do you know ? 43 Look at the chemicalequation (6). What is the type of this  reaction, in which Vanaspathi ghee is formed from vegetable oil?   The chemical  reactions in which reactants gain hydrogen are called ‚reduction™  reactions. Similarly,the reaction in which a reactantloses oxygen to form the product  is also called reduction reaction. The substance that brings about reduction is called a   reductant, or a reducing agent. When hydrogen gas is passed over black copper oxide a reddish coloured layer of  copper is formed. When the positive charge on an atom or  an  ion increases or the negative charge on them  decreases it is calledoxidation, and when the   positive charge decreases or the negative charge  increases it is called reduction.                                             CuO + H 2    Cu + H 2 O   ............. (26) Which is the reductantin this reaction? And which reactanthas undergone reduction? In this reaction an oxygen atom goes away from CuO (copper oxide), which means that  reduction of copper oxide takes place, whereas hydrogen moleculetakes up oxygen atom  and water (H 2 O) is formed meaning, oxidation of hydrogen takes place. Thus oxidation  and reduction reactions occur simultaneously. The reductantis oxidizedby the oxidant   and the oxidant is reduced by the reductant. Due to this characteristics of the reduction   and oxidation reactions, a single term ‚redox reaction™ is used in place of the two terms.        Redox Reaction = Reduction +  Oxidation 2H 2 S + SO 2        3S   + 2H 2 O   ............... (27) MnO 2  + 4 HCl       MnCl 2  + 2H 2 O + Cl 2     ............. (28) 1 . Some more examples of redox reaction are as follows.  Identify the reductants and oxidants  from them.                              A redox reaction takes place  during cellular respiration. Here  the molecule of the enzyme  called cytochrome C oxidase  helps the transport of electron to  bring about this reaction. For more information  refer to life processes in the   living organisms .   Can you tell? Use your brain power ! 2. If oxidation means losing electrons, what is meant by reduction? 3. Write the reaction of formation of Fe 2+  by reduction Fe 3+  by making use of the  symbol (e - ). The luster of the surface of the aluminium utensils in the house  is lost after a few days. Why does this happen?

Take some boiled water  in one test tube and put an oil layer on   it. Take some salt water in the second   test tube. Let there be only air in the   third test tube. Take some anhydrous   calcium chloride in the fourth test tube.   Place a small iron nail in every test   tube. Close the fourth test tube with a   rubber cork. Letall the four test tubes   remain un attended for a few days.   Observe all the four test tubes after a few days. What did you find? Which test tubes  had the nails as before? Both water and air are necessary for rusting. The rusting process   takes placerapidly  in presence of a salt. Have you seen the effect of redox reaction in  your everyday life? The new vehicles look shiny, on the contrary old vehicles look dull. A   certain type of reddish coloured solid layer collects on their metallic surface. This layer is   called ‚rust™. Its chemical formula is Fe 2 O 3   X H 2 O.   The rust on iron does not form by a simple reaction of oxygen with iron surface.  The rust is formed by an electrochemicalreaction.  Different regions on the surface of iron  become anode and cathode.   1. Fe is oxidised to Fe 2+  in the anode region. Fe (s)   Fe 2+  (aq) + 2 e - 2. O 2  is reduced to form water in the cathode region. O 2  (g) + 4H +  (aq) + 4 e -    2H 2 O (l) When Fe 2+  ions migrate from the anode region they react with water and further get  oxidised to form Fe 3+  ions. A reddish coloured hydrated oxide is formed from Fe 3+  ions. It is called rust. It collects  on the surface. 2Fe 3+ (aq) + 4H 2 O (l)   Fe 2 O 3    H 2 O (s) + 6H +  (aq)   ........... (29) Due to various components of atmosphere, oxidation  of metals takes place,  consequently resulting in their damage. This is called ‚corrosion™. Iron rusts and a reddish   colouredlayer is collected on it. This is corrosion of iron. Corrosion is a very serious   problem . We are going to study about it in the ‚metallurgy™ chapter. 1                 2                   3                 4 Try This.

When oil  or ghee is left aside for a long time or fried food is left aside for a long time it undergoes  air oxidation and becomes rancid. Rancidity in the food stuff cooked in oil or ghee is   prevented by using antioxidants. The process of oxidation reaction of food stuff can also   be slowed down by storing it in air tight container.  1.

We performed various  experiments regarding negatively and positively charged objects. The reason behind the  object becoming positively and negatively charged is the transfer of negatively charged  particles from one object to another object. In previous standard, we also studied about  electric current.  In this chapter, we will study about an electriccurrent flowing through a conducting  wire, an electric current flowing through a resistor, electromagnetic induction, electric   motor and generator. 4. Effects of electric current Energy transfer in electric circuit. Heating effects of electric current. Magnetic effects of electric current. Observe and Discuss What do you observe in the following pictures?   Which effects of electric current do you find?   1. How do we decide that a given material is a good conductor      of electricity  or is an insulator? 2. Iron is a conductor of electricity, but when we pick up a piece  of iron resting on the ground, why don™t we  get electricshock? a b Energy transfer in an electric circuit  Procedure:  Connectthe circuit as shown in the accompanying figure 4.2 after taking  the components with proper values. Measure the current (I). Also measure the potential  difference (V AB ) between the two ends (A and B) of the resistance.   The potential at A is higher than the potential at B as the point A is connected to the  positive electrode of the cell and the point B to the negative electrode of the cell.   4.1 Effects of electric current c Materials : connecting wires, electric cells, electrical resistance,  voltmeter, ammeter, plug key. Can you recall? Try this 48   If a charge Q flows from A to B,  work V AB  Q,  has been done on Q while going from A to B (Refer  to chapter 3 of std 9). From where does the energy   come to do this work? The source of energy is the   cell. The cell gives this energy through the charge   Q to the resistance where work V AB  Q is performed.  If the charge Q flows from A to B in time t, i.e. the   work is performed in timet, then during that time   the energy  V AB  Q is given to the resistor.      What  happens to this energy? This energy is  received by the resistor and is converted into heat   energy, the temperatureof the resistor is increased.  If in the circuit, the resistor is replaced by a motor,  in which form will the energy given by the cell get  transformed into?    The source of energy, the cell, gives in time t, the energy P x t to the resistor. If I is the  current flowing continuously through the circuit, the heat produced in the resistor in time t   will be H = P x t = V AB  x I x t  ................................

Heating effect of electric current When a resistor is connected in an electrical circuit, heat is produced in it due to the   current. This is known as the heating effect of current.

Think about it  P = Electrical power =  Energy   Timerequired   =   V AB  Q t = V  AB  I...................(1)   Q  t = I , 49   Equipment such as water boiler, electric cooker,  electric bulb make use of the heating effectof  electric current. Electrical conductors having higher   resistivity  are used here. For example, a coil made   up of an alloy Nichrome is used in the electric   heater-cooker as a resistor, while a tungsten wire is   used in an electric bulb. Because of the current, this   wire gets heated (to nearly 3400  0 C) and emits light.  The hot wire also radiates heat to a certain extent. Coil of cooker Coil of Heater   The unit of electric power 1W is a very small  unit, hence 1000 W or 1 kW is used as a unit to  measure electric power, in practice. If 1 kW  power is used for 1 hour, it will mean 1kW   1 hr  of electrical energy is used (see equation 1)   1kWh    =1 kilowatt hour = 1000 W × 3600 s   = 3.6 × 10 6  Ws  = 3.6 x 10 6  J   Several times  we hear or read about a  building catching fire due to short circuit.  Sometimes, if we switch on an equipment in our   house, the electrical fuse wire melts and the   electric supply shuts down. Let us discuss about   the cause briefly. The home electrical connection   consists of ‚live™, ‚neutral™ and ‚earth™ wires.   The ‚live™and the ‚neutral™ wires have potential   difference of 220V. The ‚earth™ is connected to   ground. Due to a fault in the equipment or if the   plastic coating on the ‚live™ and the ‚neutral™   wires gives way, the two wires come in contact   with each other and a large current flows through   it producing heat. If any inflammable material   (such as wood, cloth, plastic etc.) exists around   that place it can catch fire. Therefore, a fuse wire   is used as  a precautionary measure. We have   learnt about fuse wire in the previous standard.   As soon as high current flows in a circuit, the   fuse wire melts and breaks the circuit and any   mishap is avoided.    Check monthly electricity  bill received from the electricity   distribution Co. Ltd. Observe   various details and get   information about them. The   electricity bill specifies the   usage in ‚Units™. What is this   unit? When 1 kWh electrical   energy is used, it is termed as 1   unit of energy. 4.3  Uses of coil Solenoid Type coil Glass Bulb   Glass Support Screw cap Vacuum/  nitrogen gas Coiled coil Coil (Solenoid type) Find out Always remember 50   These days miniature  circuit  breakers (MCB) switches are used in  homes. When the current in the circuit   suddenly increases this switch opens   and current stops. Different types of   MCBs are in use. For the entire house,   however the usual fuse wire is used. 4.4  Different types of fuses in use   Many times  particularly in the summer season, huge electrical power is used in the  evenings due to home lighting, fans, air conditioners, use of electricityin shops etc. As a   result, excessive current is drawn from the transformer supplying the electricity, and if the   capacity of the transformer is insufficient, its fuse wire melts and the supply gets shut   down. Such events occur due to overloading.   Example 1.  A 6 m long wire made from an   alloy, nichrome, is shaped into a coil and   given for producing heat. It has a resistance   of 22 ohms. Can we get more heat if the   wire is cut into half of its original length   and shaped into a coil? For getting energy,   the two ends of the wire are connected to a   source with a potential  difference of 220V.  Given :  Resistance 22 ohm, potential   difference = 220 V  A.

Power  = 330 W Magnetic effect of electric current We have learnt about heating effect of electric current. In previous standards, we have  studied about magnets and magnetic lines of force. However, it will be interesting to see   if an electric current and magnetic field are related to each other. 52 Introduction of Scientist Hans Christian  Oersted   (1777-1851)   What do you learn from  this experiment? The  magnetic effect is observed  because of the current in the  wire. This means electricity  and magnetism are closely  related! On the contrary, if a  magnet is moved and kept  moving, will we observe any  electric effect? Is it not  exciting?  Therefore, we are  going to study magnetic fields  and such ‚electromagnetic™  effects. Finally, we will study  the principles, construction   and working of electric motor  and electric generator.   As a scientist at the forefront  in the 19th century, Hans Christian  Oersted played an important role in   understanding ‚electromagnetism™.   He observed, in 1820, that when a   current passes through a metal wire,   the magnetic needle near the wire   turns  through a certain angle. He  pointed out the relation between  electricity and magnetism. Today™s   advanced technology is developed   as a consequence. In his honour, the   unit of intensity of the magnetic   field is termed as Oersted. Connect the circuit as shown in   fig. 4.6 When a large current  (approximately 1A or more) flows  through the thick copper wire passing   through a cardboard, the magnetic  needlekept at differentpoints on the  cardboard around the wire stands in   different directions. Mark these   directions with a pencil. (Discuss with your friends and teachers  about the requirement of the current,   number of cells, cells of what potential  difference,thickness of the wire etc.,  and then perform the experiment).  The  direction of the current shown in the  circuit is its conventional direction.    What changes are caused by  increasing or decreasing current? What   do you see when the magnetic needleis  kept a little away from the wire? Now,   instead of the magnetic needle, spread   iron filings on the cardboard and  observe. The iron filings arrange  themselves in a circular manner around   the wire. Why does this happen?  You have studied magnetism and  magnetic field in previous standard.  The iron filings spread along the  magnetic lines of force.   A   magnetic field is produced around a  straight current carrying conductor. If the  current is unchanged, this magneticfield  reduces as the distance from the wire  increases. Therefore, the concentriccircles   representingthe magnetic lines of force are  shown bigger and rarefied as the distance  from the wire increases. If the current through   the wire is increased,the intensity of the   magnetic field increases.  Thick copper wire R 4.6  Magnetic field produced around the conductor Card  board Magnetic  needle  Iron filings Try this Always remember 53 Right hand thumb Rule    This  is a convenient rule for finding out the  direction of the magnetic field produced by a current  flowing through an electrical conductor. Imagine that   you have held the conductor in your right hand in   such a way that your thumb points in the direction of   the current. Then turn your fingers around the   conductor, the direction of the fingers is the direction   of the magnetic lines of force (Fig. 4.7).  Find Out  Magnetic field produced by current through a circular loop of a conducting wire. 4.8 Magnetic field produced by a current  through a loop of conducting wire Right  hand Electric  current  Magnetic  field 4.7  Right hand thumb Rule   The  right hand thumb rule is called Maxwell™s  cork-screw rule. What is the cork-screw rule?   We learnt about the magnetic lines of  force of a magneticfield produced by a   current flowing through a straight conduc -  tor. What will happen to the magnetic lines   of force of the field produced by a current   flowing through a loop made by bending   the straight wire? A circuit is completed by connecting  various components as shown in the figure   4.8. If the current passes through the loop,   magnetic lines of force are produced at   each point on the loop. As we go away   from the wire, the concentric circles   representing the magnetic lines of force   will become bigger and bigger. As we go towards the centre of the  loop the circle become so big that its arc   can be shown as a straight line.  In fig. 4.8, the magnetic lines of force are shown near the points P and Q only, however,   they will be created near each point on the loop. Likewise, each point will produce magnetic   field at the centre of the loop. By making use of the right hand thumb rule, check that every point on the loop  contributesthe magnetic lines of force at the centre of the loop and these lines of force at   the centre of the loop are in the same direction. P  Conductor loop   Cardboard  Magnetic lines A + + R I S Q N 54   The intensity of magnetic field at any point produced by a current flowing through a  wire, is dependent on the current, as we have seen in the experiment (fig 4.6 Try this). This  means that if there are n turns in the loop, the magnetic field n times of that produced by  a single loop will be created. On discussing with your teachers, with their guidance, see if you can perform the  above experiment by collecting appropriate materials. The direction of the magnetic field   can be determined with the help of a magnetic needle. Magnetic field due to a current in a solenoid.    This means that the intensity of the magneticfield within the solenoid is uniform  everywhere, i.e. the magnetic field in a solenoid is uniform. Force acting on current carrying conductor in a magnetic field Procedure :  Using the stand, fix the copper wire so that it passes through the poles of the  horse shoe magnet as shown in the figure 4.10. Connectthe circuit as well. What do you  observe?  Whenever a current is not flowing through the wire, it remains straight (position A).  When the current flows from top to bottom, the wire bends and comes into position C.  If the current direction is reversed, i.e. it flows from the bottom to the top end, the wire  bends but comes in the position B. This means the direction of the force on the wire is   perpendicular to both the magnetic field and the direction of the current.    Here, the direction  of magnetic field is from N to S, (H). In this experiment it is noted  that whenever current flows through a conductor in the presence of magnetic field a force   is exerted on the conductor. If the direction of the current is reversed, the direction of the  force also gets reversed. If the magnet is kept reversed, i.e. its south pole is brought at the  position of its North pole and its North pole brought to the position of its south pole, what  will happen? 4.9  Magnetic lines of force of a magnetic  field produced by a current passing  through a solenoid coil. Solenoid Magnetic  lines of  force N S Try this When a copper wire with a resistive  coating is wound in a chain of loops (like a  spring), it is called solenoid. Whenever an electric current passes  through a solenoid, magnetic lines of force are  produced in a pattern as shown in figure 4.9.  You are aware of the magnetic lines of  force of a bar magnet. The properties of the  magnetic fieldof a solenoid are very similarto  the magnetic field produced by a bar magnet. One of the open ends of a solenoid acts as  a magnetic north pole and the other as the   magnetic south pole. The magnetic lines of  force inside the solenoid are parallel to each  other. What does this mean?  Materials:  Flexible copper wire, stand, electric cell, a horse shoe  magnet with a strong magnetic field. 55   Fleming™s left hand rule In the above experiment we considered  the direction of the electric current and the  direction of the magnetic field and found  that the direction of the force exerted is  perpendicular to both. There is a simple  rule relating these three directions. This   rule is called Fleming™s left hand rule.  According to this rule, the left hand thumb,  index finger, and the middle finger are  stretched so as to be perpendicular to each  other. If the index finger is in the direction   of the magnetic field, and the middle finger  points in the direction of the current, then  the direction of the thumb is the direction  of the force on the conductor.  Electric Motor  You know various forms of energy. You also  know that energy can change its form. A device   changing electrical energy into mechanical  energy is known as electric motor. Around us, in  our day-to day life, an electric motor is a boon.   It is used in fans, refrigerators, mixers, washing   machines, computers, pumps, etc. How does this   motor work? Force on the  conductor  (Thumb) Direction of the   magnetic field   (Index finger) Direction of current Force on the   conductor  Direction   of the   magnetic   field  Direction of   current   (Middle finger) 4.11 Fleming™s left hand rule The above experiment clearly shows that a force is exerted  on the current carrying conductor. The direction of this force   depends on both the direction of the current and the direction   of the magnetic field.   Experimentally,  it is possible to show that this force is  maximum when the direction of the current is perpendicular   to the direction of the magnetic field. How will you do this? 4.10 Force acting on a current carrying conductor in the presence of a magnetic field 4.12   Electric motor in daily use I C B H S N I Magnet Stand  Copper wire Schematic Diagram Magnetic field  (perpendicular   to the plane   of the paper,   going inside   the paper) A Experimental Setup A B C Try this.   Determine  the direction of  the force on the wire in the above  experiment and verify your  finding. 56   The electric motor consists of  rectangular loop of copper wire having  resistive coating. As shown in the figure,   it is placed between the north pole and   south pole of a magnet (such as a horse   shoe magnet) in such a way that its   branches AB and CD are perpendicular   to the direction of magnetic field. The   two ends of the loop are connected to the   two halves (X and Y) of the split ring.   The two halves of the ring have resistive   coating on their inner surfaces and are   tightly fitted on the axle. The two halves   of the split ring, X and Y, have their   outer conducting surfaces in contact   with the two stationary carbon brushes,   (E and F), respectively. When the circuitis completedas shown in the figure, the current flows in the branch  AB of the loop from A to B through the carbon brushes E and F. Since the direction of the   magnetic field is from north pole to south pole, according to the Fleming™s left hand rule,  a force is exertedon the branch AB and pushes it down. The current in the CD branch is  in a opposite direction to that in the AB branch, and therefore, a force is exerted on the  branch CD in upward direction. Thus, the loop and the axle start rotating in an anticlockwise  direction. After half rotation, the two halves of the split ring X and Y come in contact with  carbon brushes F and E, respectively, and the current in a loop starts flowing in the direction  DCBA. Therefore, a force is exerted on the branch DC in downward direction and on the   branch BA in the upward direction, and the loop continuesto rotatein the anticlockwise   direction.  Thus, the current in the loop is reversed after each half rotation and the loop and   the axle continue to rotate in the anticlockwise direction.   Commercial  motors run on the same principle, but practical changes are made in their  construction; you will learn that later. 4.13  Electric motor: Principle and Working   Why are carbon brushes used? How do these work? In  order to find answers to such questions, visit a nearby workshop  and try to understand the construction of an electric motor. Electromagnetic Induction We have seen in the previous section that if we keep an electricconductor in a magnetic  field such that direction of the current flowing through the conductor in perpendicularto  the magnetic field, then a force is exerted on the conductor. Because of this, the conductor   moves. But if an electric conductor is moving in a magnetic field or the magnetic field   around a stationary conductor is changing, what will happen? In order to find out an   answer to this question, research was done by the great scientist Michael Faraday. In the   year 1831 Faraday showed that an electric current can be produced in a conductor with the   help of a moving magnet. Split rings  (X and Y) X Y Carbon  brushes  (E and F) F Axle Find Out  E 57 Complete the circuit as shown in figure  4.16a. Discuss about and select the  components as  required. In this experiment,  if we open the plug key and make the current  zero in the coil, the pointer of the  Galvanometer   deflects to a side and quickly  comes back to zero. If the  current in the coil   is started again, the pointer again deflects to  the other side and then returns quickly to  zero.   Now when the electrical current is  flowing through the solenoid coil and the   solenoid coil is displaced with respect to the  coil, the current is still produced in the coil.  4.14 Galvanometer 4.16  (b) when a current is passing through  the solenoid coil and the coil is displaced  laterally with respect the coil Collect the material as shown in figure  4.15. Complete the circuit by connecting the  galvanometer. Keep the bar magnet erect in   such a way that its north or south pole is just   below the copper wire. Now if the wire is   kept moving from A   B , the pointer  of the galvanometer gets deflected. This is   called Faraday™s electromagnetic induction.   Now move the magnet with the wire fixed.   The Galvanometer pointer still gets deflected.  Galvanometer  Galvanometer is a sensitive device which works on  the same principle as that of an electric motor that we  have studied earlier. We can make some electrical   measurements with it. A coil is  positioned between the  pole pieces of a magnet in such a way that the pointer on  the galvanometer dial is connected to it. When a small  current (for example 1 mA) flows through the coil, the coil   will rotate. The rotation will be proportional to the current.   Voltmeter and Ammeter also work on the same principle.  In galvanometer,  the pointer deflects on both the sides of  the zero mark depending on the direction of the current. 4.15   If a conducting wire is kept moving in a  magnetic field, a current is produced in it. Galvanometer  Battery Solenoid coil Coil  Coil  Solenoid coil Galvanometer Battery A B  Magnet 4.16  (a) When the current in the solenoid  coil is switched on or off Try this. Try this. 58 4.16  c) When a current passing  through  the solenoid coil and the  solenoid coil is displaced longitudinally  with respect to the coil   What can be inferred from these two  experiments? Even if the solenoid coil is kept stationary, a   change in current in the solenoid coil produces a   current in the coil. If the solenoid coil is moved   towards or away from the coil, we see a   deflection in the Galvanometer(fig 4.16c) Also,   the faster is the displacement of the solenoid,   larger is the deflection of the Galvanometer   pointer. If the current in the solenoid coil is   changed, a current is produced in the coil or if   the solenoid coilis moved towards the coil,then   also a current is produced in the coil.  Faraday™s law of induction: If a current is switched on or off in the  solenoid coil, a current is induced in the coil.   Such as induction is also observed when the   current in the solenoid coil is increased or   decreased. Current is induced in the coil when it   is moved aside from front of the solenoid. From   these experiments it is understood that whenever   the number of magnetic lines of force passing   through the coil changes, current is induced in   the coil. This is known as Faraday™s law of   induction. The current produced in the coil is   called the induced current.  Fleming™s right hand rule : When will the induced current in the electrical  conductor (coil) be maximum? It will be maximum  when the direction of motion of the electric   conductor is perpendicular to the magnetic field.   In order to show the direction of the induced   current, Fleming™s right hand rule is very useful.   Stretch the thumb, the index finger and the middle  finger in such a way that they will be perpendicular  Galvanometer Battery Motion of a  conductor Direction of   the magnetic   field  Direction of the  induced current Direction of  the induced   current Motion of a conductor Direction   of the  magnetic  field  4.17  Fleming™s right hand rule    Michael Faraday  (1791-1867) was an experimental  scientist. He was not formally educated. Teenager Michael  started working in a bookbinding shop. While reading books  there, he got interestedin science. Sir Humphrey Davy appointed  him as a laboratory assistant in the Royal Institute London. There   he discovered the laws of  electromagnetic induction and the laws  of electrolysis. Several Universities offered him honorary degree,  but Faraday refused to accept such honours.  Introduction to Scientist Coil  Solenoid coil  to each other. In this position, the thumb indicates the direction of motion of the conductor,  the index finger the direction of the magnetic field, and the middle finger shows the direction  of the induced current. This rule is known as Fleming™s right hand rule (fig 4.17). 59 So far we have learnt about a non  oscillatory current flowing in one direction,  in a circuit, from the cell to the cell. Such a   current is called a direct current (DC) as   against a current changing in magnitude   and direction after equal intervals of time   which  is called alternating current (AC). The direct current can increase, can be  stable, or can reduce also, but it is not   oscillatory. This is shown graphically in   the figure. Alternating current is oscillatory.   As shown in the graph (fig 4.19), it increases   to a maximum, then reduces to zero and   increases to maximum in the other direction   and again reduced to zero. (in the figure,   magnitudes like -1, -2 have been used to   show the reverse direction). The oscillation   of the alternating current occurs in a   sinusoidal manner with time and hence is   shown by the symbol ~. Directcurrent   flows in one direction, but the alternating   current flows in periodic manner, in one   cycle, in forward and reverse directions.  time (s) Current Ampere Direct current(DC) Alternating current (AC) Current Ampere time (s) increasing dc reducing dc stable dc 4.18   AC current and DC current 4.19 Alternating current and  Direct current (Graphical)   In India, in  the power stations generatingelectricity, one cycle changes in       second  i.e. the frequency of AC is 50 Hz (50 cycles per second).  When the electric power is  transmitted over a long distance, it is beneficial to have it in AC form as it results into   minimum power loss during transmission. The home supply is of alternating current (AC).  We have learnt in the previous class about  the precautions to be taken while using the   electricity.  Electric Generator  We have seen the experiments based on electromagneticinduction. The current produced  in these experimentswas of very small magnitude. But the same principlecan be harnessed  for the use of mankind to produce large current. Here, mechanical energy is used to rotate  the current carrying coil in a magnetic field, around an axle, thereby producing electricity.   Fig 4.20 shows  a copper wire coil ABCD, kept between the two pole pieces of a magnet.  The two ends of the coil are connected to the conducting rings R 1   and R 2  via carbon brushes.  Both the rings are fixed to the axle, but there is a resistivecoatingin between the ring and  the axle. The axle is rotated with the help of a machine from outside. Because of this, the  coil ABCD starts rotating. The stationary carbon brushes B 1  and B 2   are connected to a  galvanometer, which shows the direction of current in the circuit. Upon rotating the axle, the  branch AB goes up and the branch CD goes down (i.e. the coil ABCD rotates clockwise).   1 50 Alternating current (AC) and Direct Current (DC) 60   According  to Fleming™s right hand rule,  electric current is produced in the branches  AB and CD in the direction. A   B and      C D. Thus, the current flows in the  direction A  B  C  D (as shown by  arrows in the figure). In the external circuit,   the current flows from B 2  to B 1  through the  galvanometer. If instead of one loop coil, a   coil consisting of several turns is used, the   current of magnitude several times flows.   After half rotation, the branch AB takes the   place of branch CD and the branch CD takes   the position of the branch AB. Therefore, the   induced current goes as D  C  B  A .   But, the branch BA is always in contact with the brush B 1  and branch DC in the contact  with B 2 . Hence, in the external circuit current flows from B 1  to B 2  i.e. opposite to the  previous half rotation.This repeats after every half rotationand alternating current is   produced. This is what is called an AC generator . What will  be required to make a DC generator?  The DC does not change the direction  in the external circuit. To achieve this, a split ring is fixed on the axle like a split ring used   in electric motor. Because of this arrangement,the branch of the coil going upwards is   always in contactwith one brush and the branch going downwards is always in contact   with  the other brush. Hence, the current flows in one direction in the external circuit. This   is why this generator is called as a DC generator.  Draw the diagram of a DC generator.

What are the different ways of heat transfer? In the previous standard, we have learnt about heat and different types of heat transfer.  We have also performed few experiments related to expansion and contraction of solids,  liquids and gases. We have learnt about the difference between heat and temperature. We  have also seen how temperature is measured using  a thermometer.   Concept s like latent heat of phase transformation, anomalous behaviour of water,  dew point, humidity, specific heat capacity etc. are related to certain phenomena experi - enced by us in our day-to-day life. Let us learn more about these concepts.  1.   Take a few pieces of ice in a glass  beaker.  As shown in figure 5.1.  2.   Insert  the bulb of a thermometer in ice and  measure its temperature. 3.   Put the beaker on a stand and heat the ice  using a burner. 4.   Record  the temperature using the  thermometer after every minute. 5.   As the  ice is heated, it starts melting. Stir  the mixture of ice and water. 6.   Continue the heating  even after ice starts  melting. 7.   Draw a graph of temperature versus time. You will observe that the temperatureof the mixture remains 0  0 C  till the ice melts  completely. If we continue heating, even after conversion of all the ice into water, the  temperature of water starts rising and reaches 100  0 C . At this temperature water starts  converting into steam. The temperature of water remains constant at 100  0 C  till all water  converts into steam. The graph of temperature versus time is shown in figure 5.2. In this graph, line AB represents conversion of ice into water at constant temperature.  When ice is heated it melts at 0  0 C  and converts into water at this constant temperature.  The ice absorbs heat energy during this transition and the absorption of energy continues  till all the ice converts into water.  Latent heat 5.1  Latent heat   Can you recall? Try this Thermometer Ice cubes/pieces Stand Burner 63   The temperature remains constant  during this transition. This constant  temperature, at which the ice converts into   water is called the melting point of ice. Thus, during transitionof solid phase to  liquid, the object absorbs heat energy, but its   temperature does not increase. This heat  energy is utilised for weakening the bonds  between the atoms or molecules in the solid   and transform it into liquid phase. The heat   energy absorbed at constant temperature   during transformation of solid into liquid is   called the latent heat of fusion. The amount of heat energy absorbed at constant temperature by unit mass of  a  solid to convert into liquid phase is called the specific latent heat of fusion.  Once all the ice is transformed into water, the temperature of water starts rising. It  increases u p to 100  0 C. Line  BC in the graph represents rise in temperature of water from   0  0 C to 100  0 C. Thereafter, even though heat energy is supplied to water, its temperature  does not rise. The heat energy is absorbed by water at this temperature and used to break  the bonds between molecules of the liquid and convert the liquid into gaseous state. Thus,  during transformation from liquid phase to gas phase, heat energy is absorbed by the  liquid, but its temperature does not change. The constant temperature at which the liquid  transforms into gaseous state is called the boiling point of the liquid. The heat energy  absorbed at constant temperature during transformation of liquid into gas is called the  latent heat of vapourization. The amount of heat energy absorbed at constant temperature by unit mass of a  liquid to convert into gaseous phase is called the specific latent heat of vapourization.  Different substances have different melting points and boiling points. The values of  melting point, boiling point and latent heat depend on atmospheric pressure. 1.   Is the  concept of latent heat applicable during trans - formation of gaseous phase to liquid phase and from  liquid phase to solid phase? 2.   Where  does the latent heat go during these  transformations? 5.2 Temperature vs Time Graph Substance Melting  point  0 C Boiling  point  0 C Specific latent heat of  fusion Specific latent heat of  vaporization kJ/kg cal/g kJ/kg cal/g Water/ Ice 0 100 333 80 2256 540 Copper 1083 2562 134 49 5060 1212 Ethyl alcohol -117 78 104 26 8540 200 Gold 1063 2700 144 15.3 1580 392 Silver 962 2162 88.2 25 2330 564 Lead 327.5 1749 26.2 5.9 859 207 Boiling water + Vapour  Time  (Minutes) Water Liquid   0 C Ice+ Water (Solid+liquid) Use your brain power ! Liquid - Gaseous state 64 Activity: 1.   Put a slab of ice on a stand as shown in Figure 5.3. 2.   Hang two  equal weights to the two ends of a metal  wire and put the wire on the slab as shown in the  figure.   What do you observe?   It is observed that the wire gradually penetrates the ice  slab. After some time, the wire comes out of the lower   surface of the ice slab. However, the ice slab does not   break. The phenomenon in which the ice converts to   liquiddue to appliedpressure and then re-converts to   ice once the pressure is removed is called regelation.    The melting point of ice becomes lower than 0  0 C    due to pressure. This means that at 0  0 C, the ice gets  convertedinto water. As soon as the pressure is   removed, the melting point is restored to 0  0 C and  water gets converted into ice again.  2.    Is there any relations hip of latent heat with the regelation? 3.   Y ou know that as we go higher than the sea level, the boiling point of water decreases What would be effect on the melting point of solid? 5.3 Regelation Weight Ice Regelation   You may have seen the preparation of  an ice-ball. First, an ice slab is shredded and  then the shredded ice is pressurised around the tip of a stick to prepare the ice-ball. How  does the shredded ice convert into solid ice ball? If two small pieces of ice are taken and  pressed against each other for a while, they stick to each other. Why does this happen?  Take a small slab of ice, a thin wire, two identical weights.  Try this Use your brain power ! 1.   In the above experim ent, the wire moves through  the ice slab. However, the ice slab does not break.  Why? Can you tell? Anomalous behaviour of water  In general, when a liquid is heated up to a certain temperature, it expands, and when  cooled it contracts. Water, however, shows a special and exceptional behaviour.  If we  heat water from 0  0 C  up to 4  0 C, it contracts instead of expanding. At 4  0 C its volume is  minimum (due to contraction). If the water is heated further, it expands and its volume   increases. The behaviour of water betweenits temperature from  0  0 C to 4  0 C is called  anomalous behaviour of water.  If 1 kg of water is heated from 0  0 C and its volume is plotted as a function of temperature,  we get the graph, shown in fig 5.4. At 4  0 C, the volume of water is minimum. It means that  the density of water is maximum at 4  0 C. We feel that some objects are cold, and some are hot. Is this  feeling related in some way to our body temperature? 65 Specific Volume (cm 3 /g) Temperature  o C 5.4  Graph between the volume and temperature of water   Study of anomalous behaviour  of water using Hope™s apparatus. The anomalous behaviour of  water can be studied with Hope™s  apparatus. In Hope™s apparatus, a flat  bowl is attached to a cylindrical   container as shown in figure 5.5. There  is provision to attach thermometers  above (to measure temperature T 2 )  and below (to measure temperature  T 1 ) the flat bowl on the cylindrical  container. Water is filled in the   cylindricalcontainer and a mixture of  ice and salt (freezing mixture) is put in  the flat bowl.   During the study of anomalous behaviour of water using Hope™s apparatus, temperature  T 1  and T 2  are recorded after every 30 seconds.  The temperatures are plotted on the Y-axis and the time in minutes on the X-axis. The  graph is shown in figure 5.6. The graph shows that initially, both the temperatures T 1  and T 2  are identical. However, as time passes, temperature T 1  of water in the lower part of the  cylinder decreases fast, while, temperature T 2  of water in the upper part of the cylinder  decreases comparatively slowly.  However, once the temperature T 1  of the lower part reaches 4   0 C, it remains almost stable  at that temperature. T 2  decreases slowly to 4  0 C. Thereafter, since T 2  starts changing rapidly,  it records 0  0 C first and after that the lower thermometer T 1  records 0  0 C temperature. The  point of intersection of the two curves shows the temperature of maximum density.  How can we explain these  observations? Initially, the temperature of  water in the middle of cylinder lowers due  to freezing mixturein the outer bowl. Since  the temperature of water there decreases,  its volume decreases, and its density  increases. The water with higher density  moves downwards. Therefore, the lower  thermometer T 1  shows rapid fall in  temperatureand this continues till the   temperature of water becomes equal to 4  0 C. When the temperature of water starts  decreasing below 4  0 C, its volume increases,  and density decreases. It, therefore, moves   in the upward direction. The temperature  of water in upper part (T 2 ), therefore,  decreases rapidly to 0  0 C. The temperature  of water in the lower part (T 1 ), however,  remains at 4  0 C for some time and then  decreases slowly to 0  0 C. 5.5 Hope™s Apparatus Freezing   mixture Thermometer   T 2 Thermometer  T 1 4  0 C   0  0 C Freezing   mixture 66 5.6  Time - Temperature Graph How will you explain following statements with  the help of the anomalous behaviour of water? 1.  In regions with cold climate, the aquatic plants and animals can survive even when the   atmospheric temperature goes below 0  0 C (See figure 5.7). 2.  In cold regions in winter the pipes for water supply break and even rocks crack.  Dew point and Humidity About 71% surface of the Earth is covered with water. Due to constant evaporation of  water, water vapour is always present in the atmosphere. The amount of water vapour in   the atmospherehelps us to understand the state of daily weather.  The presenceof water   vapour in the air makes it moist. The moisture in the atmosphere is called humidity. For a given volume of air, at a specific temperature, there is a limit on how much  water vapour the air can contain. If the amount exceeds this limit, the excess vapour   converts into water droplets. When the air contains maximum possible water vapour, it is  said to be saturated with vapour at that temperature. The amount of vapour needed to  saturate the air depends on temperature of the air. If air temperature is low, it will need less  vapour to saturate the air. For example, if temperature of air is 40  0 C, it can contain 49  grams of water vapour per kilogram of dry air without condensation. If the amount of  vapour exceeds this limit, the additional vapour will condense. However, if the temperature  of air is 20  0 C, it can contain only 14.7 grams of water vapour per kilogram of dry air  without condensing. If the vapour contained in air is less that the maximum limit, then the  air is said to be unsaturated.  Suppose unsaturated air at a certain temperature is taken and its temperature is  decreased, a temperature is reached at which the air becomes saturated with vapour.  This temperature is called the dew point temperature.        The vapour content  in the air is measured using a physical quantity called  absolute  humidity. The mass of vapour present in a unit volume of air is called absolute humidity.   Generally absolute humidity is measured in kg/m 3 . The feeling of humid or dry nature of air not only depends on the amount of vapour in  the air, but it also depends on how close that amount is for making the air saturated with   vapour. It means that it depends on temperature of the air also.  The ratio of actual mass of vapour content in the air for a given volume and temperature  to that required to make the air saturated with vapour at that temperature is called the   relative humidity. 5.7   Aquatic animals in cold regions         5    10     15     20    25    30    35   40    45      Time (Minutes)  Temperature  0 C  Use your brain power ! actual mass of water vapour content in the air in a given volume mass of vapour needed to make the air saturated in that volume % Relative humidity= x 100 T 2 T 1 Ice Layer 67   The  relative humidity at the dew point is 100%. If the relative humidity is more than  60% we feel that the air is humid. If the relative humidityis less than 60%, we feel that the  air is dry. During winter season, you may have observed a white trail at the back of  a flying  plane in a clear sky. As the plane flies, the vapour released by the aeroplane engine   condenses and forms clouds. If the surrounding air is having more relative humidity, it   takes a long time for the white trail, formed by condensation of the vapour, to disappear.   If relative humidity of the surrounding air is less, either the size of the white trailmay be   small or it may not even get formed. 1. Take a bottleof cold water out of a refrigerator and keep it  outside for a  while. Observe the outer surface of the bottle.  2. Drops of water can be observed on the outer surface of bottle. In  the same way, if we observe the leaves of plants/grass or  window-glass of a vehicle in the early morning we see water  droplets collected on the surface.  Through these two observations, we sense the presence of water vapour in the  atmosphere. When air cools, due to decrease in temperature it becomes saturated with  water vapour. As a result, the excess  water vapour gets converted into tiny droplets. The   dew-point temperature is decided by the amount of vapour in the air. Unit of heat   The unit s of heat are Joule (J) in SI units, cal (calorie) in cgs units.    The amount of heat necessary to raise tempe rature of  1 g of water by 1  0 C from       14.5  0 C to 15.5  0 C is called one cal heat.   Similarl y, the amount of heat necessary to raise the  temperature of 1 kg of water by  1  0 C from 14.5  0 C to 15.5  0 C is called one kcal heat.   It is clea r that (1 kcal= 1000 cal).   If we heat 1 kg of water by 1 0 C in different temperature range than 14.5  0 C to     15.5  0 C, the amount of heat required will be slightly different. It is, therefore, essential  to define a specific temperature range while defining the unit of heat. Calorie and Joule  are related by following relation: 1 cal = 4.18 Joule Introduction to Scientist   James Prescott Joule (1818-1889) : He was the first person to  show that the kinetic energy of tiny particles of matter appears as  heat energy and also that energy can be converted from one form  to another. Conversion of heat energy to work gives the first law of  thermodynamics. The unit of heat is called Joule (J) after him. Try this. Always remember 68 Specific Heat Capacity Procedure  : 1. Take three spheres of iron, copper and  lead of equal mass (Fig. 5.8) 2. Put all the three spheres in boiling water  in the beaker for  some time. 3. Take the three spheres out of the water.  All the spheres will be at temperature 100   0 C. Put them immediately on the thick slab  of wax.  4. Note, the depth that each of the sphere   goes into the wax. Material :  A tray with thick layer of wax, solid spheres of iron,   lead and copper of equal mass, burner or spirit lamp, large beaker. 5.8 Specific heat capacity of metals Iron Copper Lead Wax layer   The  sphere which absorbs more heat from  the water will give more heat to wax. More  wax will thus melt and the sphere will go deeper in the wax. It can be observed that the   iron sphere goes deepest into the wax. Lead sphere goes the least and copper sphere goes   to intermediatedepth. This shows that for equal rise in temperature, the three spheres have   absorbed differentamounts of heat. This means that the property which determines the   amount of heat absorbed by a sphere is different for the three spheres. This property is   called the specific heat capacity.   The amount of heat energy required to raise the temperature of a unit mass of an  object by 1  0 C is called the specific heat of that object. The specific heat  capacity is denoted by letter ‚c™. The SI unit of specific heat is J/  0 C  kg,  and the CGS unit is cal/g  0 C.  S. No. Substance Specific heat (cal/g  0 C ) S. No. Substance Specific heat (cal/g  0 C ) 1. Water 1.0 5. Iron 0.110 2.

In the same way if specific heat of an object is ‚c™, the mass of the object is ‚m™ and if  the temperature of the object is decreased by  T   0 C, then the heat energy lost by the object  will be,       m   c    T. 69 5.10 Box of heat resistant  material ICT :      Prepare a presentatio n using videos, pictures, audios, graphs etc. to explain  various concepts in this chapter. Collect all such material from the Internet, using  Information Technology. Under the guidance of your teachers, arrange a competition of  such  presentations in your class.   Solved Examples Example 1 : How much heat energy is necessary to raise the temperature of 5 kg of water  from 20  0 C to 100  0 C. Given: m= 5 kg, c = 1 kcal/kg  0 C and change in temperature   100-20 = 80  0 C    Energy to be supplied to water = energy gained by water      = mass of water  specific heat of  water   change in temperature of water    = m   c    T    = 5   80  0 C    = 400 kcal Hence, the heat energy necessary to raise the temperature of water = 400 kcal. Heat Exchange  If heat is exchanged between a hot  and cold object, the temperature of the cold object goes  on increasing due to gain of energy and the temperature  of the hot object goes on decreasing due to loss of   energy. The change in temperature continues till the  temperatures of both the objects attain the same value.  In this process, the cold object gains heat energy and   the hot object loses heat energy. If the system of both  the objects is isolated from the environment by keeping  it inside a heat resistant box (meaning that the energy  exchange takes place between the two objects only),  then no energy can flow from inside the box or come into the box (fig 5.10). In this situation,  we get the following principle Heat energy lost by the hot object = Heat energy gained by the cold object.  This is called  as ‚Principle of heat exchange™ Measurement of specific heat: (mixing method) and calorimeter The specific heat of an objectcan be measured using mixingmethod.For this calorimeter  is used. You have learnt about calorimeterin  the previous standard. If a hot solid object is  put in the water in a calorimeter, heat exchange between the hot objectand the water and  calorimeter starts. This continues till the temperatures of the solid object, water and the   calorimeter become equal. Therefore,  Heat lost by solid object = heat gained by water in calorimeter + heat gained by the calorimeter. Here, heat lost by the solid object (Q) = mass of the solid object   its specific heat   decrease in  its temperature. Similarly, Heat gained by the water (Q 1 )= mass of the water   its specific heat   increase in its temperature Heat gained by the calorimeter (Q 2 )= mass of the calorimeter   its specific heat   increase in its  temperature.    Heat lost by hot object = Heat gained by calo rimeter + Heat gained by water. Q = Q 2 + Q 1   Using these  equations, if the specific heat of water and the calorimeter are known, the  specific heat of the solid object can be calculated.  Hot  object Cold object 70 Example 2:  A copper sphere of 100 g mass is heatedto raise its temperature to 100  0 C and   is released in water of mass 195 g and temperature 20  0 C in a copper calorimeter. If the  mass of calorimeter is 50 g, what will be the maximum temperature of water? Given : Specific heat of copper = 0.1 cal/g  0 C    And so specific heat of calorimeter= 0.1 cal/ g  0 C    Suppose the copper ball water and the calorimeter attain final temperature T.    Heat lost by solid object  = heat gained by water in calorimeter + heat gained by the  calorimeter.    Here, heat lost by the copper ball = mass of the copper  specific heat of copper             decrease in temperature of the ball    Q = 100   0.1   (100 - T) Similarly,    Heat  gained by the water = mass of the water X its specific heat X increasein its  temperature         Q 1  = 195  1 T - 20 and Heat gained by the calorimeter = mass of the calorimeter  its specific heat   increasein  its temperature   Q 2 = 50   0.1   (T - 20)   Q = Q 1  + Q 2   100   0.1   (100 - T) = 195   1   (T - 20) + 50   0.1   (T - 20)   10 (100 - T) = 195 (T - 20) + 5 (T - 20)   10 (100 - T) = 200 (T - 20)   210 T = 5000   T = 23.8  0 C   The maximum temperature of water will be 23.8  0 C. Example 3 : If 80 g steam of temperature 97  0 C is released on an ice slab of temperature  0  0 C, how much icewill melt? How much energy will be transferred to the icewhen the  steam will be transformed to water? Given : Latent heat of melting the ice = L melt = 80 cal/g     Latent heat of vaporization of water = L vap . = 540 cal/g Solution :    mass of steam = m steam = 80 g     Temperature of steam = 97  0 C     Temperature of ice = T ice = 0  0 C    Heat released during conversion of steam of temperature 97  0 C into water of     temperature 97  0 C = m steam    L vap.      = 80 X 540  --------------------------- (1)    Heat released during conversion of water of 97  0 C into water at 0  0 C     = m steam     T   c     = 80  97 - 0)  1 = 80  97 -------------- (2)    Total heat gained by the ice  80  540 + 80  97 from equations (1) and (2)     = 80 (540 + 97)     = 80  637 50960 cal. 71 Books are My Friends : Read for more information 1.

What are the laws of reflection?   We have seen that, generally  light travels in a straight line.  Because of this, if an  opaque object lies in its path, a shadow of the object is formed. We have also seen in   previous classes how these shadows change due to the change in relativepositions of the  source of light and the object.But light can bend under some special circumstances as we  will see below Activity 1:  1.

Now keep the pencil inclined to water    surface and observe its thickness.   In both cases, the portion of the pencil  inside water appears to be thicker than the  portion above water. In the second case,  the pencil appears to be broken near the  surface of water. Why does it happen?   In both the above activities  the  observed effects are created due to the change in  the direction of light while coming out of water.   Light changes its direction when going  from one transparent medium to another transparent medium. This is called the  refraction of light. Activity 3: 1. Keep a glass slab on a blank paper and draw its outline PQRS as shown in figure 6.1.   2. Draw an inclined straight line on the side of PQ so that it intersects PQ at N. Pierce two  pins vertically at two points A and B along the line.  3. Look at the pins A and B from the opposite side of the slab and piercepins C and D  vertically so that the images of A and B are in line with C and D.  4. Now remove the chip and  the pins and draw a straight line going through points C and  D so that it intersects SR at M.  5. Join points M and N. Observe the incident ray AN and emergent ray MD. Refraction of light Activity 2:  1. keep a 5 rupee coin in a metallic vessel.  2. Slowly go away from the vessel 3. Stop at the place when the coin         disappears.  4. Keep looking in the direction of the coin.  5. Ask a friend to slowly fill water in the  vessel. You will be able to see the coin  once the    level of water reaches a  certain height. Why does it happen? Material:  Glass, 5 rupee coin, Pencil, metallic vessel etc. Can you recall? Try this. 74 The first refraction occurs when lightray  enters the glass from air at N on the side PQ. The  second refraction occurs when light enters air  through glass at point M on the side SR. For the  first refraction the angle of incidence is i while   for the second it is i 1 . The angle of refraction at N  is r. Note that i 1  = r. In the second refraction,the  angle of refraction is e which is equal to i. On  both parallel sides PQ and RS of the glass slab,  the change in direction of light ray is equal but in   opposite directions.  Thus, the light ray MD emerging from the  glass slab is parallel to the incident ray AN on   the side PQ of the slab. But the emergent ray is   somewhat displaced with respect to the incident  ray.  6.1  Refraction of light passing  through a glass slab P S Q R Refraction  of light M C D A B N    r i i 1 e Glass Air Air A C N B r i 6.2 Light ray entering a glass slab from air D Glass Air Incident ray  Refracted  ray sin i sin r = constant = n     n  is called the refractive index  of the second mediumwith respect  to the first medium. This second law  is also called Snell™s law. A ray  incident along the normal (i = 0)  goes forward in the same direction  (r = 0). 1. Will light travel through a glass slab with the same  velocity as  it travels in air? 2.  Will the velocity of light be same in all media?   Laws of refraction Let us study the light ray entering a glass  slab from air as shown in the figure 6.2. Here AN  is the incident ray and NB is the refracted ray.  1. Incident ray and refracted ray at the point of   incidence N are on the opposite sides of the   normal to the surface of the slab at that point  i.e. CD, and the three, incident ray, refracted  ray and the normal, are in the same plane.  2. For a given pair of media, here air and glass,  the    ratio of sin i to sin r  is a constant. Here, i  is the angle of incidence and r is the angle of   refraction.  Refractive index The change in the direction of a light ray  while entering different mediais different. It is  related to the refractiveindex of the medium.  The value of the refractive index is different for   differentmediaand also for lightof different   colours for the same medium.The refractive  indices of some substances with respect to  vacuum are given in the table. The refractive   index of a mediumwith respectto vacuum is  called its absolute refractive index. Refractive index depends on the velocity  of light in the medium. Use your brain power ! 75 Let the velocity of light in medium 1 be v 1  and in  medium 2 be v 2  as shown in figure 6.3. The refractive  index of the second medium with respect to the first  medium,  1 n 2  is equal to the ratio of the velocity of light  in medium 1 to that in medium 2.

When a light ray  passes from a rarer  medium  to a denser a  medium, it bends  towards  the normal.     When  a light ray  passes from a denser  medium to  a rarer   medium, it bends away   from the normal.   When a light ray is incident  normally at the boundary   between two media, it does not   change its direction and hence   does not get refracted. If the first medium is vacuum then the refractive index of medium 2  is called absolute refractive index and it is written as n.

Have you seen a mirage which is an illusion of the appearance  of water on a hot road or in a desert? 2. Have you seen that objects beyond and above a holi fire appear  to be  shaking? Why does this happen? Effect of atmospheric conditionson refraction of lightcan be seen in the twinkling of  the stars.   Stars are self-luminous and can be seen at night in the absence of sunlight. They  appear to be point sources because of their being at a very large distance from us.  As the  desity of air increases with  lowering height above the surface of the earth, the refractive  index also increases. Star light coming towards us travels from rarer medium to denser  medium and constantly bends towards the normal. This makes the star appear to be higher   in the sky as compared to its actual position as shown in the figure, 6.6.  The apparent position of the star keeps changing a bit. This is because of the motion  of atmospheric air and changing air density and temperature. Because of this, the refractive   index of air keeps changing continuously. Because of this change, the position and   brightness of the star keep changing continuously and the star appears to be twinkling.  Local atmospheric conditions affect the refraction of light to some extent. In both the  examplesabove, the air near the hot road or desert surface and near the holi flames is hot   and hence rarer than the air above it.  The refractive index of air keeps increasing as we  go to increasing heights. In the first case above, the direction of light rays, coming from a  distance, keeps changing according to the laws of refraction.  The light rays coming from a  distant object appear to be coming  from the image of the objectinside  the ground as shown in figure 6.5.   This is called a mirage.   In the second example, the  direction of light rays coming from   objects beyond the holi fire changes  due to changing refractive index  above the fire. Thus, the objects   appear to be moving. Cold air Hot surface Hot air 6.5    Mirage 6.6  Apparent position of a star   Star Apparent position of a star   increasing  refractive   index 6.7 Effect of atmospheric refraction Apparent position Horizon Earth Real position Atmospheric layers Can you tell? 77 We do not see twinkling of planets. This is because, planets are much closer to us as  compared to stars. They, therefore,do not appear as point sources but appear as a collection  of point sources. Because of changes in atmospheric refractive index the position as well  as the brightness of individual point source change but the average position and total   average brightness remains unchanged and planets do not twinkle.  By Sunrise we mean the appearance of the Sun above the horizon.  But when the Sun  is somewhat below the horizon, its light rays are able to reach us along a curved path due   to their refraction through earth™s atmosphere as shown in the figure 6.7. Thus, we see the   Sun even before it emerges above the horizon. Same thing happens at the time of Sunset  and we keep seeing the Sun for a short while even after it goes below the horizon. Dispersion of light  Hold the plastic scale in your compass in front of your eyes and see through it while  turning it slowly. You will see light rays divided into different colours. These colours appear  in the following order: violet, indigo, blue, green, yellow, orange and red. You know that  light is electromagnetic radiation. Wavelength is an important property of radiation. The  wavelength of radiation to which our eyes are sensitive is between 400  and 700 nm. In this  interval, radiation of different wavelengths appears to have different colours mentioned   above. The red light has maximum wavelength i.e. close to 700 nm while violet light has  the smallest wavelength, close to 400 nm. Remember that 1 nm = 10 -9  m. In vacuum, the velocity of light rays of all frequencies is the same. But the velocity of  light in a medium depends on the frequency of light and thus different colours travel with   different velocity. Therefore, the refractive index of a medium is different for different  colours. Thus, even when white light enters a single medium like glass, the angles of  refraction are different for different colours. So when the white light coming from the Sun  through air, enters any refracting medium, it emerges as a spectrum of seven colours.  The process of separation of light into its component colours while passing  through a medium is called the dispersion of light. Sir Isaac Newton was the first person to  use a glass prism to obtain Sun™s spectrum.  When white light is incident on the prism,   different colours bend through different angles.   Among the seven colours, red bends the least   while violet bends the most. Thus, as shown in   figure 6.8, the seven colours emerge along   differentpaths and get separated and we get a   spectrum of seven colours.  6.8   Dispersion of light Sun light R O Y  G  B  I  V Glass Prism 1. From incident white light how will you obtain white  emergent light by making use of two prisms? 2. You must have seen chandeliers having glass prisms. The light from a tungsten bulb  gets dispersed while passing through these prisms and we see coloured spectrum. If we  use an LED light instead of a tungsten bulb, will we be able to see the same effect? Use your brain power ! 78 Partial and total internal reflection  When light enters a rarer medium from a denser medium, it gets partially reflected i.e.  part of the light gets reflected and comes back into the denser medium as per laws of  reflection. This is called partial reflection. The rest of the light gets refracted and goes into   the rarer medium.     For a particular value of i, the value of r becomes equal to 90 o . This value of i is called   the critical angle. For angles of incidence larger than the critical angle, the angle of  refraction is larger than 90 o . Such rays return to the denser mediumas shown towards the  right in figure 6.9.  Thus, all the lightgets reflected back into the dense medium. This is   called total internalreflection. We can determine the value of the critical angle the as  follows.     Rainbow is a beautiful natural  phenomenon. It is the  combined effect of a  number of natural processes. It is the combined   effect of dispersion, refraction and total internal   reflection of light. It can be seen mainly after a   rainfall. Small droplets of water act as small   prisms. When light rays from the Sun enter   these droplets,  it gets refracted and dispersed.   Then there is  internal reflection as shown in   the figure, and after that once again the light   gets refracted while coming out of the droplet.   All these three processes together produce the   rainbow.  6.10  Rainbow production  6.9 Partial and total internal reflection Partial reflection Total internal  reflection Refracted Rays Air  Water   i i 1 i c i i c r r 1   r=90 0    Light  source       1 n 2  = sin i sin r For total internal reflection,   i = critical angle,   r = 90 0 Some Fun   Try to see if you  can see dispersion of   light using plastic jar,   mirror and water. As light is going from  denser to rarer medium, it  bends away from the  normal i.e. the angle of   incidence i, is smaller  than the angle of  refraction r. This is shown   on the left side of the  figure 6.9. If we increase  i, r will also increase   according to Snell™s law   as the refractive index is  a constant. 1. Why the Sky is Blue - Dr. C.V.

Indicate the following terms related to spherical mirrors in  figure 7.1: poles, centre of curvature,radius of curvature,  principal focus. 2. How are concave and convex mirrors constructed?  Lenses You must have seen lenses used in day to  day life. Some examples are: the lenses used   by old persons for reading, lens embedded in   the front door of the house, the lens which the  watch maker attaches to his eye etc. Lenses are used in spectacles. They are  also used in telescopes as you have learnt in   the previous standard.  7.1  Spherical mirror  A lens is a transparent medium bound by two surfaces. The lens which has two  spherical surfaces which are puffed up outwards is called a convex or double convex lens.   This lens is thicker near the centre as compared to the edges. The lens with both surfaces  spherical on the inside is called a concave or double concave lens. This lens is thinner at   the centre as compared to its edges.  Different types of lenses are  shown in figure 7.2. A ray of light   gets refracted twice while passing   through a lens, once while entering  the lens and once while emerging  from the lens. The direction of the   ray changes because of these   refractions. Both the surfaces of  most lenses are parts of a sphere.

The cross-sections of convex and concave lenses are shown in parts a and b of figure  7.3. The surface marked as 1 is part of sphere S 1  while surface 2 is part of sphere S 2 .  Can you recall? Bicon - vex     Plano  Convex    Positive Meniscus Plano   Concave    Negative   Meniscus 7.2  Types of lenses Bicon -  cave 81 Centre of curvature (C) :   The centres of spheres whose  parts form surfaces of the lenses are called centres of  curvatures of the lenses.  A lens with both surfaces  spherical, has two centres of curvature C 1  and C 2 .  Radius of curvature (R)   :  The radii (R 1  and R 2 ) of the  spheres whose parts form surfaces of the lenses are  called the radii of curvature of the lens. Principal axis  : The imaginary line passing through   both centres of curvature is calledthe principalaxis of  the lens.  Optical centre (O) :     The point inside a lens on the  principal axis, through which light rays pass without   changing their path is called the optical centre of a lens.  In figure 7.4, rays P 1 Q 1 , P 2 Q 2  passing through O are  going along a straight line. Thus O is the optical centre   of the lens.  Principal focus (F)  : When light rays parallel to the   principal axis are incident on a convex lens, they  converge to a point on the principal  axis. This point is  called the principal focus of the lens. As shown in figure   7.5a F 1  and F 2  are the principal foci of the convex lens.  Light rays parallel to the principal axis falling on a convex lens come together i.e. get  focused at a point on the principal axis. So this type of lens is called a converging lens.   Rays travelling  parallel to the principal axis of a concave lens diverge after refraction  in such a way that they appear to be coming out of a point on the principal axis. This point   is called the principal focus of the concave lens. As shown in figure 7.5b F 1  and F 2  are the  principal foci of the concave lens.     Light rays parallel to the principal axis fallin g on a concave lens go away from one  another (diverge) after refraction. So this type of lens is called a divergent lens.   Focal length (f) :   The distance between the optical centre and principal focus of a lens is  called its focal length.  7.4  Optical centre of a lens P 1 Q 1 P 2 Q 2 P 3 Q 3 P 1 Q 1 Q 3 Q 2 P 2 P 3 O O Material : Convex lens, screen, meter scale, stand for the lens etc. 7. 5  Principal focus of a lens  F 1 F 2 F 1 F 2 f f Method :     Keeping the  screen fixed, obtain a clear image of a distant objectlike a tree or a  buildingwith the help of the lens on the screen.  Measure the distancebetween the screen   and the lens with the help of the meter scale. Now turn the other side of the lens towards  the screen. Again obtain a clear image of the distant object on the screen by moving the  lens forward or backward. Measure the distance between the screen and the lens again.

Rule 2: When the incident ray   passes through the principal   focus, the refracted ray is   parallel to the principal axis.  Rule 3: When the incident ray   passes through the optical   centre of the lens, it  passes  without changing its direction. 7. 6   Arrangement for the experiment Can you recall? Convex lens Screen Candle F 2 2F 2 O F 1 2F 1 spherical mirrors. Similarly, one can obtain the images formed by lenses with the help of ray  diagrams. One can obtain the position, size and nature of the images with the help of these   diagrams.  Images formed by convex lenses  One can use following three rules to draw ray diagrams of images obtained by convex  lenses. What is this distance between the lens and the screen called? Discuss the relation  between this distance and the radius of curvature of the lens with your teacher. The image   of a distant object is obtained close to the focus of the lens, hence, the above distance is the  focal length of the lens. What will happen if you use a concave lens in this experiment? Ray diagram for refraction :   You have learnt the rules for drawing ray diagrams for  Material:  A convex lens, screen, meter scale, stand for the lens,  chalk, candle etc. Method:  1. Draw a straight line along the centreof a  long table.  2. Place the lens on the stand at the central  point (O) of the line. 3. Place the screen on one side, of the lens.  Move it along the line so as to get a clear   image of a distant object. Mark its  position as F 1 .  4. Measure the distance between O and F 1 .  Mark a point at distance 2F 1  from O on  the same side of F 1  and mark it as 2F 1 . 5. Repeat actions 3 and 4 on the other side of the lens and mark F 2  and 2F 2  on the straight  line.  6. Now place the burning candle on  the other side of lens far beyond 2F 1 . Place the screen  on the opposite side of the lens and obtain a clear image of the candle by moving it  forward or backward along the line. Note the position, size and nature of the image. 7. Repeat action 6 by placing the candle beyond 2F 1 , at 2F 1 , between 2F 1  and F 1 , at F 1  and  between F 1  and O. Note your observations. What are real and virtual images? How will you find  out whether  an image is real or virtual? Can a virtual  image be obtained on a screen? 83 As shown in the figure 7.7, an object  AB is placed beyond the point 2F 1 . The  incident ray BC, starting from B and going  parallel to the principal axis, goes through  the principal focus F 2  after refraction along  CT. The ray BO, starting from B and  passing through the optical centre O of the  lens goes along OS without changing its   direction. It intersects CT in B . This means  that the image of B is formed at B .    As A is situated on the principal axis, its image will also be located along the principal  axis at A , vertically above B .  Thus, A B  will be the image of AB formed by the lens. So  we learn that if an object is placed beyond 2F 1 , the image is formed between F 2  and 2F 2 .  It is real and inverted and its size is smaller than that of the object.   S.

When the incidentray is parallel to the principal axis, the refracted ray when extended  backwards, passes through the focus. 2. When the incident ray passes through the focus, the refracted ray is parallel to the  principal axis.  Study figure 7.8. Determine the  position, size and nature of images  formed for different positions of an  object  with the help of ray diagrams.   Check your  conclusions and  observations in the previous activity  with those given in the table. 84 As shown in figure 7.9, object PQ is placed between F 1  and 2F 1  in front of a concave  lens. The incident ray PA, starting from P and going parallel to the principal axis goes  along AD after refraction. If AD is extended backwards, it appears to come from F 1 .  The incident ray PO, starting from P and passing through O, goes along the same direction   after refraction. PO intersects the extended ray AF 1  at P 1 , i.e. P 1  is the image of P.

Thus, P 1 Q 1  is the imageof PQ.  The imageformed by a concave  lens is always virtual, erect and  smaller than the object. 7.10  Cartesian sign convention 1      1          1  v     u      f  -  -  -  =  -   The lens formula is same for any spherical lens and any distance  of the object from the lens. It is however necessary to use the sign  convention properly. Sign convention What is the Cartesian sign convention used for spherical  mirrors? Direction of incident ray Distance on the left  of the origin (-ve) Distance on the right  of the origin (+ve) Direction of incident ray Distance on the left  of the origin (-ve) Distance on the right  of the origin (+ve) x Lens formula  The formula showing the relation between distance of the object (u), the distance  of the image (v) and the focal length (f) is called the lens formula. It is given below. Height above - ve Height below Height above Principal axis + ve - ve Height below Principal axis + ve x Can you recall? 85    According to the Cartesian sign conventio n, the optical centre (O) is taken to be  the origin. The principle axis is the X-axis of the frame of reference. The sign  convention is as follows. 1. The object is always placed on the left of the lens, All distances parallel to the principal  axis are measured from the optical centre (O). 2. The distanced measured to the right of O are taken to be positive while those measured  to the left are taken to be negative.  3. Distances perpendicular to the principal axis and above it are taken to be positive.  4. Distances perpendicular to the principal axis and below it are taken to be negative.  5. The focal length of a convex lens is positive while that of a concave lens is negative. P  =      1 f (m) 1     1          1 f      f 1        f 2 - =  -  +   -    If the powers of the two lenses are P 1  and P 2  then the effective power of their  combination is P = P 1  + P 2 . Thus, when two lenses are kept touching each other, the  power of the combined lens is equal to the sum of their individual powers. Magnification (M) The magnification due to a lens is the ratio of the height of the image (h 2 ) to the height  of the object (h 1 ).  h 2 h 1 Magnification =      Height of the Image     Height of the object           i.e.   M =                    ..................

Take  two convex lenses of different sizes. Collect sunlight on a paper using one of the  lenses. The paper will start burning after a while. Note the time required for the paper to   start burning. Repeat the process for the second lens. Is the time required the same in both   cases? What can you tell from this ? Power of a lens  The capacity of a lens to converge or diverge incident rays is called its power (P). The  power of a lens depends on its focal length. Power is the inverse of its focal length(f); f is  expressed in meters.   The unit  of the power of a lens is Dioptre (D).      1  Dioptre    =      1   1 m Combination of lenses   If two lenses with focal lengths f 1  and f 2  are kept in contact with each other, the  combination has an effective focal length given by    i.e.   M =                    ..................

Given: Focal length = f = 20 cm = 0.2 m Power of the lens = P = ? Study the model depicting the construction of  human eye with the help of teachers. v  = 20 cm The positive sign of the image distance  shows that imageis formed at 20 cm on the  other side of the lens.   1. An object is placed vertically at a  distance of 20 cm from a convex lens. If   the height of the object is 5 cm and the  focal length of the lens is 10 cm, what will   be the position, size and nature of the  image?How much bigger will the image  be as compared to the object? Given :  Height of the object (h 1 ) = 5 cm,  focal length (f) = 10 cm,  distance of the object (u) = - 20 cm Image distance (v) = ?,   Height of the image (h 2 ) = ?,  Magnification (M) = ? P  =   1 f (m)   =   1 0.2    = 5 D   There is a very thin transparent cover ( membrane) on the human eye. This is called  cornea (fig 7.11). Light enters the eye through it. Maximum amount of incident light is  refracted inside the eye at the outer surface of the cornea. There is a dark, fleshy screen  behind the cornea. This is called the Iris. The colour of the Iris is different for different   people. There is a small hole of changing diameter at the centre of the Iris which is called  the pupil. The pupil controls the amount of light entering the eye. If the light falling on the  eye is too bright, pupil contracts while if the light is dim, it widens. On the surface of the iris,   there is bulge of transparent layers. There is a double convex transparent crystalline lens,   just behind the pupil. The lens provides small adjustments of the focal length to focus the  image. This lens creates real and inverted image of an object on the screen inside the eye.  This screen is made of light sensitive cells and is called the retina.  These cells get  excited when light falls on them and generate electric signals. These signals are conveyed   to the brain through optic nerve. Later, the brain analyses these signals and converts them  in such a way that we perceive the objects as they actually are.

While seeing nearby objects   the lens becomes more rounded and its focal   length decreases as shown in part b of the   figure 7.12. This way we can see objects clearly  irrespective of their distance.  The capacity of the lens  to change its focal length as  per need is called its power of   accommodation. Although   the elastic lens can change its   focal length, to increase or   decrease it, it can not do so   beyond a limit.    The eye ball is approximately spherical and has a diameter of about 2.4 cm. The  working of the lens in human eye is extremely important.  The lens can change its  focal length to adjust and see objects at different distances. In a relaxed state, the focal  length of healthy eyes is 2 cm. The other focus of the eye is on the retina.

Optic  disc   The minimum distance of an object from a normal eye, at which it is clearly visible  without stress on the eye, is called as minimum distance of distinct vision. The position  of the object at this distance is called the near point of the eye, for a normal human eye,  the near point is at 25 cm. The farthest distance of an object from a human eye, at  which it is clearly visible without stress on the eye is called farthest distance of distinct  vision. The position of the object at this distance is called the far point of the eye. For   a normal human eye, the far point is at infinity. Sclerotic  coat Choroid 88 1. Try to read a book keeping it very far from your eyes. 2. Try to read a book keeping it very close to your eyes. 3. Try to read a book keeping it at a distance of 25 cm from your eyes. At which time you see the alphabets clearly? Why?   Defects of Vision and their corrections Some people can not see things clearly due to loss of accommodation power of the  lenses in their eyes. Because of defective refractionby the lenses theirvision becomes  faint and fuzzy. In general, there are three types of refraction defects. 1. Nearsightedness/ Myopia                            In this case, the eye can see nearby  objects clearly but the distant objects  appear indistinct.  This means that the far point of the eye is   not at infinity but shifts closer to the eye. In nearsightedness, the imageof a distant  object forms in front of the retina (see   figure 7.13). There are two reasons for   this defect. 1. The curvature of the cornea and the  eye lens increases.The muscles near the  lens can not relax so that the converging   power of the lens remains large. 2. The  eyeball elongates so that the  distance between the lens and the retina  increases.  This defect can be corrected by using spectacles with concave lens of proper focal  length. This  lens diverges the incident rays and these diverged rays can be converged by  the lens in the eye to form the image on the retina. The focal length of concave lens is  negative, so a lens with negative power is required for correcting nearsightedness. The  power of the lens is different for different eyes depending on the magnitude of their  nearsightedness. 2. Farsightedness or hypermetropia In this defect the human eye can see  distant objects clearly but cannot see nearby   objects distinctly. This means that the near  point of the eye is no longer at 25 cm but shifts  farther away. As shown in the figure (7.14),   the images of nearby objects get formed behind  the retina.  There are two reasons for farsightedness.  1. Curvature of the cornea and the eye lens  decreases so that, the converging power of the  lens becomes less.  2. Due to the flattening of the eye ball the  distance between the lens and retina decreases. Try this. Nearby objects can be seen clearly                Correction of Nearsightedness   Myopic eye   Concave lens 7.13 Nearsightedness  Faraway objects  can be seen clearly Hypermetropic eye Correction of Farsightedness Convex lens 7.14 Farsightedness 89   This defect can be corrected  by using a convex lens with proper focal length. This lens  converges the incident rays before they reach the lens. The lens then converges them to  form the image on the retina.   The focal length of a convex lens is positive thus the spectacles  used to correct  farsightedness has positive power. The power of these lenses is different depending on the   extent of farsightedness.   Sometim es people suffer from nearsightedness as well as farsightedness. In such a  case bifocal lenses are required to correct the defect. In such lenses, the upper part is  concavelens and correctsnearsightedness while the lower part is a convex lens which   corrects the farsightedness.  3. Presbyopia   Generally, the  focusing power of the eye lens decreases with age.  The muscles near  the lens lose their ability to change the focal length of the lens. The near point of the lens   shifts farther from the eye. Because of this old people cannot  see nearby objects clearly.  www.physics.org  www.britannica.com  Get more information from   the following websites. Apparent size of an object    Consider two objects , PQ and P 1 Q 1 , having same  size but kept at different distances from an eye as   shown in figure 7.15. As the angle  subtended by  PQ at the eye is larger than the angle  subtended by  P 1 Q 1 , PQ appears bigger than P 1 Q 1 . Thus, the  apparent size of an object depends on the angle   subtended by the object at the eye. 1. Why do we have to bring a small object near the  eyes  in order to see it clearly? 2. If we bring an object closer than 25 cm from the  eyes, why can we not see it clearly even though it  subtends a bigger angle at the eye? 7.15   Apparent Size of An object. Use of concave lenses a.

But minute objects like  blood cells, cells of plants and animals   and minute living beings like bacteria  cannot be magnified sufficiently  by simple  microscope. Compound microscopesare   used to study these objects.  A compound  microscope is made of two convex lenses:  objective and eye piece. The objective has   smaller cross-section and smaller focal  length. The eye piece has bigger cross- section, its focal length is also larger than  that of the objective. Higher magnification  can be obtained by the combined effect of   the two lenses.  7.16 Simple microscope a. Object is close to the lens    b.  Object is at the focus  7.17 A compound microscope   As shown in the  figure 7.17, the magnification occurs in two stages. The image formed  by the first lens acts as the object for the second lens. The axes of both lenses are along the   same line. The lenses are fitted inside a metallic tube in such a way that the distance  between can be changed.  c. Telescope   Telescop e is used to see distant objects clearly in their magnified form. The telescopes  used to observe astronomical sources like the stars and the planets are called astronomical  telescopes. Telescopes are of two types. 1. Refracting telescope Œ This uses lenses 2. Reflecting telescope Œ This uses mirrors and also lenses.  In both of these, the image formed by the objective acts as objectfor the eye piece  which forms the final image. Objective lens has large diameterand larger focal length  because of which maximum amount of light coming from the distant object can be   collected.

These are used for watch repair, testing precious gems and finding their defects. 91 On the other hand the size of  the eyepiece is smaller and its  focal length is also less. Both the  lenses are fitted inside a metallic  tube in such a way that the  distance between them can be  changed. The principal axes of   both the lenses are along the  same straight line. Generally,  using the same objective but   different eye pieces, different  magnification can be obtained. 7.18  Refracting telescope  Eye piece Objective  lens 1.

Twist the  thread and leave it. What do you see and why? Persistence of vision  We see an object because the eye lens createsits image on the retina.The imageis on  the retina as long as the object is in front of us. The image disappears as soon as the object  is taken away. However, this is not instantaneous and the image remains imprinted on our  retina for 1/16th of a second after the object is removed. The sensation on retina persists  for a while. This is called persistence of vision. What examples in day to day life can you  think about this? d. Optical instrument  Convex lenses are used in various other  opticalinstruments like camera, projector,   spectrograph etc. How do we perceive different colours? Try this. Can you tell? The retina in our eyes is made up of many light sensitive cells. These cells are shaped  likea rod and likea cone. The rod likecellsrespond to the intensity of lightand give   information about the brightness or dimness of the object to the brain. The conical cells  respond to the colour and give information about the colour of the object to the brain.  Brain processes all the informationreceived and we see the actual image of the object.  Rod like cells respond to faint light also but conical cells do not. Thus we perceive colours  only in bright light. The conical cells can respond differently to red, green and blue colours.   When red colour falls on the eyes, the cells responding to red light get excited more than  those responding to other colours and we get the sensation of red colour. Some people lack  conical cells responding to certain colours. These persons cannot recognize those colours   or cannot distinguish between different colours. These persons are said to be colour blind.  Apart from not being able to distinguish between different colours, their eye sight is  normal.  e.

Metallurgy     Earth was  born about 4.5 billion years ago. Various formative processes have been  taking placein the core of the earth and its surroundings since its creation till today. These  have resulted in the formation of various ores, liquids and gases. Think about it Which method do we use when we want to study many things   together and at the same time?     The substances around us are in the form of some or the  other elements or their  compounds. In the beginning, elements were classified in accordance with their chemical   and physical properties into the types metals, nonmetals and metalloids, and these are in  use even today. You have studied their characteristics in the last standard. We are going  to get more information about them in this lesson.     What are the physical properties of metals and nonmetals? Physical properties of metals   Metals exist mainly in solid state. The meta ls namely, mercury and gallium exist in  liquid state at room temperature. Metals possess luster. The metallic luster goes on   decreasing due to exposure to atmospheric oxygen and moisture and also in presence of  some reactive gases. We know that metals have the propertiesnamely, ductility and malleability. Similarly,  all metals are good conductors of heat and electricity. Generally, all metals are hard.  However, the alkali metals from group 1 such as lithium, sodium and potassium are   exceptions. These metals can be cut with knife as they are very soft. Metals have high  melting and boilingpoints. For example, tungsten metal has the highest melting point  (3422  0 C). On the contrary, the melting and boiling points of the metals such as sodium,  potassium, mercury, gallium are very low. A sound is produced when certain metals are  struck. This is called  sonority. These metals are known as sonorous metals. Physical properties of nonmetals When properties of nonmetals are considered, it is found that some nonmetals are in  solid state while some are in gaseous state. Exception is the nonmetal bromine which  exists in liquid state. Nonmetals do not possess luster, but iodine is the exception as its  crystals are shiny. Nonmetals are not hard. Diamond which as an allotrope of carbon is   the exception. Diamond is the hardest natural substance. Nonmetals have low melting and  boiling points. Nonmetals are bad conductors of electricity and heat. Graphite, an allotrope  of carbon, is an exception, as it is a good conductor of electricity. Physical properties of nonmetals   Reactivity series of metals    Ionic compounds. Can you tell? 94   Substances which are good conductors of heat  are usually good conductors of electricity as well.  Similarly bad conductors of heat are also bad  conductors of electricity. The exception is diamond  which is bad conductor of electricity but good  conductor of heat. Chemical properties of metals   Apparatus :  Pair of tongs or spatula, knife, burner, etc. Chemicals :  Samples of aluminium, copper, iron,   lead, magnesium, zinc and sodium.  ( Note:  Use sodium carefully, in presence of teacher) Procedure :  Hold the sample of each of the above  metals at the top of the flame of a burner with the help  of a pair of tongs, or a spatula. 1.   Which metal catches fire readily? 2.   How does the  surface of a metal appear on  catching fire? 3.   What  is the colour of the flame while the metal is  burning on the flame? Reactions of Metals:  a. Reaction of metals with oxygen            Metals combine with oxygen on heating in air and metal oxides are formed. Sodium  and potassium are very reactive metals. Sodium metal combines with oxygen in the air   even at room temperature and forms sodium oxide.       4Na(s) + O 2  (g)    2Na 2 O(s)   On  exposure to air sodium readily catches fire. Therefore, to prevent accident in the  laboratory or elsewhere it is kept in kerosene. Oxides of some metals are soluble in water.   They react with water to form alkali.              Na 2 O (s) + H 2 O ( l )   2NaOH (aq) We know that magnesium oxide is formed on burning magnesium ribbon in the ai r.  Magnesium oxide reacts with water to form an alkali, called magnesium hydroxide.        2Mg(s) + O 2  (g)     2 MgO(s)        MgO + H 2 O                        Mg(OH) 2 b.

Prepare a table with reference to the above      procedure and note your observations in it. Metals are reactive. They lose  electrons easily and become  positively charged ions. That is why  metals are called electropositive  elements.  Do you know ?

Procedure: 1.   Take a clean copper wire and a  clean iron nail. 2.   Dip the  copper wire in ferrous  sulphate solution and the iron nail  in copper sulphate solution.  3.   Keep on observing continually at  a fixed interval of time. a.   In which test tube a reaction has  taken place? b.   How did you recognize  that a  reaction has taken place? c.   What is the type of the reaction? Reactivity series of metals We have seen that reactivity of all metals is not the same. However, the reagents  oxygen, water and acids are not useful to determine the relative reactivities of all the metals,  as all the metals do not react with them. The displacement reaction of metals with solutions  of salts of other metals serves this purpose. If a metal A displaces another metal B from the  solution of its salt then it means that the metal A is more reactive than the metal B.

In the previous activity, iron has displaced copper from copper sulphate. It means that  metallic iron is more reactive than metallic copper.   Scientist s have developed the  reactivity series by doing many  experiments of displacement  reaction. The arrangement of  metals in the increasing or  decreasing order of reactivity is  called the reactivity series of   metals. Metals are divided into  the following groups according to  their reactivity. 1.   Highly reactive metals. 2.   Moderately reactive metals. 3.   Less reactive metals. f. Reaction of metals with nonmetals Noble gases (like helium, neon, argon) do not take part in the chemical reactions. So  far, we have seen from the reactionsof metalsthat cations are formed by oxidationof   metals. If we look into the electronic configuration of some metals and nonmetals, it will  be seen that the driving force behind a reaction is to attain the electronic configuration of  the nearest noble gas with complete octet. Metals do this by losing electrons while   nonmetals do this by gaining electrons. The outermost shell of noble gases being complete,  they are chemically inert. You have seen in the last standard that the ionic compound sodium chloride is formed  as sodium metal gives away one electron while the nonmetal chlorine takes up one electron. 2 Na   +   Cl 2                      2 NaCl         Similarly, magnesium and potassium form  the ionic  compounds MgCl 2   and KCl, respectively.         Chemical properties of nonmetals Nonmetals are a collection of elements having less similarity in physical and chemical  properties. Nonmetals are also called electronegative elements, as they form negatively  charged ions by accepting electron. Some examples  of chemical reactions of nonmetals  are as follows. 1.Reaction of nonmetals with oxygen:   Generally, nonmeta ls combine with  oxygen to form acidic oxides. In some cases, neutral oxides are formed. 8.5  Reactivity series of metals.

Reaction of nonmetals with water :  Generally, nonmetals do not react with water,  except the halogens. For example, chlorine on dissolving in water gives the following  reaction. 3.   Reaction of  dilute  acids with nonmetals :  Generally, nonmetals do not react with  dilute acids, halogens are exception to this. For example, chlorine reacts with dilute   hydrobromic acid by the following reaction. 4.   Reaction of nonmetals with hydrogen :       Nonmetals react with  hydrogen under certain  condition (such as proper temperature, pressure,   use of catalyst, etc.)  Ionic compounds The compounds formed from two units, namely cation and anion are called ionic  compounds. The cation and anion being oppositely charged, there is an electrostaticforce  of attraction between them. You know that, this force of attraction between cation and  anion is called as the ionic bond. The number of cations and anions in a compound and  the magnitude of the electric charge on them is such that the positive and negative charges  balance each other. As a result, an ionic compound is electrically neutral. Ionic compounds are crystalline in nature. The surfaces of all the particles of a  crystalline substance have a definite shape and are smooth and shiny. The regular   arrangement of ions in the solid ionic compounds is responsible for their crystalline nature.  The arrangement of ions is different in different ionic compounds, and therefore the shapes   of their crystals are different. The main factor that determines the general arrangement of  ions in a crystal is the attractiveforce between oppositely charged ions and the repulsive  force between similarly charged ions. Because of this the general crystalline structure has  negative ions arranged around a positive ion and positive ions arranged around a negative  ion. Two of the important factors responsible for a certain crystal structure are as follows.  1)   Size of the positively and negatively charged ions. 2)   Magnitude of the electrical charge on the ions. The electrostatic attraction in the neighbouring ions with opposite charges is very  strong. That is why the melting points of ionic compounds are high. Also, the ionic  compounds are hard and brittle.

Can this transformation be called  oxidation? Which is the oxidant that brings about this oxidation?     Apparatus:  Metal spatula, burner, carbon electrodes, beaker, cell,                  lamp, press  key, electrical wires, etc.  Chemicals:  Samples of sodium chloride, potassium iodide and         barium chloride, water.

Try this. 99   General properties of ionic compounds                                                   1. The attractive force between the positively  and negatively charged ions is strong  Therefore, the ionic compounds exist in solid   state and are hard. 2. The ionic compounds are brittle and can be  broken into pieces by applying pressure. 3. The intermolecular force of attraction is high   in ionic compounds and, large energy is  required to overcome it. Therefore, the  melting and boiling points of ionic compounds   are high. (see table 8.7) 4. Ionic compounds are water soluble. This is    because the water molecules orient in a  particular manner around the ions separated    by dissociation process. As a result of this a   new force of attraction is established between  the ion and the surrounding water molecules,   replacing the original intermolecular   attraction; and aqueous solutions of ionic  compounds are formed. Ionic compounds are  however, insoluble in solvents like kerosene    and petrol. This is because unlike water a  new attractive force can not be established in  these solvents.

The  ionic compounds cannot conduct  electricity when in solid state. In this  state the ions cannot leave their places.  However, in the fused/molten state  they can conduct electricity, as in this   state the ions are mobile. The aqueous  solutions of ionic compounds conduct  electricity as they contain the   dissociated ions. On passing current   through the solution the ions move to  the oppositely charged electrodes. Due  to the electrical conductivityin fused   and dissolved state the  ionic  compounds are called electrolytes. Metallurgy The science and technology regarding the extraction of metals from ores and their  purification for the use is called metallurgy. Occurrence of metals Most metals being reactive do not occur in nature in free state but are found in  combined state as their salts such as oxides, carbonates, sulphides and nitrates. However,   the most unreactive metals that are not affected by air, water and other natural factors like  silver, gold, platinum,generally occur in free state. The compounds of metals that occur  in nature along with the impurities are called minerals.  Burner  salt sample lamp press key  beaker    graphite rod salt solution  electric cell     b. To check conductivity of salt solution a. To heat salt sample 8.6 To verify the properties  of ionic compounds 8.6 Melting and boiling points of some ionic  compounds 100   The  minerals from which the metalcan be separated economically are calledores.  Ores contain many types of impuritiessuch as soil, sand and rocky substances along with  the metal compounds. These impurities are called gangue. Metals can be extracted from  their ores by means of various methods of separation. The process of extraction of metal  in pure state from the ores is also a part of metallurgy. Ores are taken out from the mines and the gangue is usually separated from the ore at  the site itselfby various methods. Then the ores are carried out to the placewhere metals   are produced. There metals are extracted in pure form. Then metals are further purified by  different methods of purification. This entire process is called metallurgy. Basic principles of metallurgy   Pure metal is obtained from the ore by the fo llowing stages. 1.   Concentration of ores The process of separating gangue from the ores is called concentration of ores. In this  process the concentration of the compound of the desired metal is increased. Various ways  are used for this purpose. However,  exactway to be used depends upon the physical  properties of the metal present in the ores and the gangue. It also depends upon the  reactivity of the metal and the facilities available for the purification. Various factors that  could be responsible for the environmental pollution are also considered. Some general   methods for the concentration of ores are as follows. a.   Separation based on gravitation The heavy particlesof ores can be easily separated from the light particlesof gangue  by the gravitational method. The processes to carry out this separation are as follows. i.   Wilfley  table method ii.   Hydraulic separation method The hydraulic separation method is based on the working of a mill. There is a tapering  vessel similar to that used in a grinding mill.It opens in a tank-like containerthat is  taperingon the lower side. The tank has an outlet for water on the upper side and a water  inlet on the lower side.  In this methodof separation, the  Wilfley table is made by fixing narrow and  thin wooden riffles on inclined surface.  The table is kept vibrating continuously.  Powdered ore obtained from lumps of the  ore using ball mill is poured on the table   and a stream of water is also released from  the upper side. As a result, the lighter  gangue particles are carried away along  with the flowing water, while the heavier  particles in which proportion of minerals is   more and proportion of gangue is less, are  blocked by the wooden riffles and get  collected on the slits between them. water   powdered ore   slits  vibrating  table gangue  concentrated ore 8.8  Wilfley table method 101 Finely ground ore is released in the  tank. A forceful jet of water is introduced  in the tank from the lower side. Gangue  particles are lighter and therefore they flow  out along with the water jet from the outlet  on the upper side of the tank and get  collected separately. At the same timethe   heavy particles of the ore are collected at  the bottom from the lower side of the tank.  In short, this method is based on the law of   gravitation, wherein particles of the same  size are separated by their weight with the  help of water. Collect the information  about the different steps of  metal extraction & explain it   in the class. Collect the related videos.  b .    Magnetic separation Method :  This method requires an electromagnetic machine.  The main parts of this machine are two types of iron rollers and the conveyor belt moving  continuously around them. One of the rollers is nonmagnetic while the other is  electromagnetic. The conveyor belt moving around the rollers is (nonmagnetic) made up  of leatheror brass. The powdered ore is poured on the conveyor belt near the nonmagnetic  roller. Two collector vessels are placed below the magnetic roller.  The particles of the nonmagnetic  part in the ore are not attracted  towards the magnetic roller.   Therefore, they are carried further  along the belt and fall in the  collector vessel places is away  from the magnetic roller.At the  same timethe particles of the   magnetic ingredients of the ore  stick to the magnetic roller and  thereforefall in the collector vessel   near the magnetic roller.   In this way the magnetic and nonmagnetic ingredients in the ore can be separated  depending on their magnetic nature. For example, cassiterite is a tin ore. It contains mainly   the nonmagnetic ingredient stannic oxide (SnO 2 ) and the magnetic ingredient ferrous  tungstate (FeWO 4 ). These are separated by the electromagnetic method. c.   Froth floatation method The froth floatation method is based on the two  opposite properties, hydrophilic and hydrophobic, of  the particles. Here the particles of the metal sulphides,  due to their hydrophobic property, get wetted mainly  with oil, while due to the hydrophilic property the  gangue particles  get wetted with water. By using these   properties certain ores are concentrated by froth  floatation method. Internet my friend powdered ore   gangue   ore suspension  concentrated  ore water   8.9 Hydraulic separation Collectors 8.10 Magnetic separation Nonmagnetic   roller Collector Powdered ore Nonmagnetic  ingredient  Magnetic ingredient Conveyor belt Magnetic    roller 102 In this method the finely ground ore  is put into a big tank containing ample  amount of water. Certain vegetable oil   such as pine oil, eucalyptus oil is added   in the water for the formation of froth.   Pressurised air is blown through the   water. There is  an agitator rotating   around its axis in the centreof the   floatation tank. The agitator is used as   per the requirement. Bubbles are formed   due to the blown air. Due to agitation a   foam is formed from oil, water and air   bubbles together, due to the agitating.   This foam rises to the surface of water   and floats. That is why this method is  called froth floatation process. Particles of certain sulphide ore float with the foam on water as they preferentially get  wetted by the oil. For example, this method is used for the concentration of zinc blend (ZnS)   and copper pyrite (CuFeS 2 )   During the extraction  of metals from their ores, metal is obtained from the cation of  metal. In this process the metal cation is to be reduced. How to bring about the reduction   depends upon the reactivity of the metal. We have already learnt about the reactivity series   of metals. 2. Extraction of metals   a. Extraction of reactive metals The metals at the top of the reactivity series are  highly reactive. Their reactivity decreases  down the series. For example, potassium, sodium, aluminium are reactive metals. Reactive  metals have large capacity to form cations by losing the electrons in their outermost shell.   For example, reactive metals react vigorously with dilute acids to give hydrogen gas. Highly   reactive metals burn by reacting with oxygen from air at room temperature. Their extraction   has to be done by electrolytic reduction. For example, the metals sodium, calcium and   magnesium are obtained by electrolysis of their molten chloride salts. In this process metal   is deposited on the cathode while chlorine gas is liberated at the anode. The electrode reactions   during the electrolysis of molten sodium chloride to get metallic sodium are as shown below. Water does not stick  to colocasia leaves.  Similarly,water does not   stick to wax. On the other   hand common salt or   soap stick to water that   is, they get wetted by   water. d.   Leaching  The first step in the extraction of the metals  aluminium,  gold and silver from their ores is the method of leaching. In  this method the ore is soaked in a certain solution for a   long time. The ore dissolves in that solution due to a   specific chemical reaction. The gangue, however, does not   react and therefore does not dissolve in that solution. So it   can be separated. For example, concentration of bauxite,   the aluminium ore, is done by leaching method. Here   bauxite is soaked in aqueous NaOH or aqueous Na 2 CO 3  which dissolves the main ingredient alumina in it. What is the electronic definition of oxidation and reduction?

We are now going to see how aluminium is obtained by electrolytic reduction of  aluminium oxide in the ore bauxite. Extraction of Aluminium. In the Hall™s process the ore is powdered and then leached by heating with aqueous  sodium carbonate in the digester to form water soluble sodium aluminate. Then the   insoluble impurities are filtered out. The filtrate is warmed and neutralised by passing   carbon dioxide gas through it. This results in the precipitation of aluminium hydroxide.        In the  Bayer ™s process the ore is first ground in a ball mill.Then it is leached by heating  with concentrated solution of caustic soda (NaOH) at 140 to 150  0 C under high pressure  for 2 to 8 hours in a digester. Aluminium oxide being amphoteric in nature, it reacts with  the aqueous solution of sodium hydroxide to form water soluble sodium aluminate. This  means that bauxite is leached by sodium hydroxide solution.                 Al 2 O 3  2H 2 O (s) + 2 NaOH (aq)     2NaAlO 2  (aq) + 3 H 2 O ( l )   The iron oxide in the gangue does not dissolve in aqueous sodium hydroxide. It is  separated by filtration. However, silica in the gangue dissolves in aqueous sodium  hydroxide to form water soluble sodium silicate. Aqueous sodium aluminate is diluted by putting in water and is cooled to 50  0 C. This  results in precipitation of aluminium hydroxide.             NaAlO 2  + 2H 2 O       NaOH + Al(OH) 3          Use your brain power ! Aluminium  Symbol : Al       Colour : Silver white  Atomic number : 13      Electronic configuration: 2, 8, 3      Valency : 3 Aluminium being reactive metal does not occur in nature in free state. Aluminium is  the third highly abundant element in the earth crust after oxygen and silicon. Aluminium   is extracted from its ore bauxite (Al 2 O 3 nH 2 O). Bauxite contains 30% to 70% of Al 2 O 3  and  remaining part is gangue. It is made up of sand, silica, iron oxide etc. There are two steps  in the extraction of aluminium. i.   Concentration of bauxite ore:     Bauxite is the main ore of aluminium.  Silica (SiO 2 ), ferric oxide (Fe 2 O 3 ) and titanium  oxide (TiO 2 ) are the impurities present in bauxite. Separation of these impurities is done  by leaching  process using either Bayer ™s method or Hall™s method. In both these methods  finally the concentrated alumina is obtained by calcination. . 104   Al 2 O 3 2H 2 O (s) + Na 2 CO 3 (aq)   2NaAlO 2 (aq) + CO 2    + 2 H 2 O (l) 2NaAlO 2 (aq) + 3H 2 O + CO 2 (g)      2Al (OH) 3     + Na 2 CO 3 The precipitate of Al(OH) 3  obtained in both, Bayer ™s and Hall™s processes is filtered,  washed, dried and then calcined by heating at 1000  0 C to obtain alumina.  2Al(OH) 3    Al 2 O 3  + 3H 2 O a. In this method electrolysis  of molten mixture of  alumina (melting point >  2000  0 C) is done in a steel  tank. The tank has a  graphite lining on the inner  side. This lining does the  work of a cathode. A set of  graphite rods dipped in the   molten electrolyte works as  anode. Cryolite (Na 3 AlF 6 )  and fluorspar (CaF 2 ) are  added in the mixture to   lower its melting point up  to 1000  0 C. b.   Aluminium is deposited on the cathode on  passing electric current. Molten aluminium being   heavier than the electrolyte, is collected at the bottom  of the tank. It is taken out from there from time to time,  Oxygen gas is liberated at the anode. 1.   What are the moderately reactive metals? 2.   In which form do the moderately reactive metals occur in       nature? The metals in the middle of the reactivity series such as iron, zinc, lead, copper are  moderately reactive. Usually they occur in the form of their sulphide salts or carbonate. It  is easier to obtain metals from their oxides rather than sulphides or carbonates. Therefore,  the sulphide ores are strongly heated in air to transform them into oxides. This process is  called  roasting . Carbonate ores are strongly heated in a limited supply of air to transform  them into oxides. This process is called  calcination . The following reactions occur during roasting and calcination of zinc ore. Roasting            2 ZnS + 3O 2                   2 ZnO + 2 SO 2  Calcination        ZnCO 3              ZnO +CO 2     The liberated oxygen reacts with the anodes to form carbon dioxide gas. The anodes  have to be changed from time to time as they get oxidised during the electrolysis of alumina. b.

ZnO + C          Zn + CO      Identify the substances undergone oxidation and reduction in this reaction. The heat evolved in the above reaction is so large that the metal is formed in the  molten state. Another similar example is the thermit reaction. Here, iron oxide reacts with  aluminium to form iron and aluminium oxide. Fe 2 O 3  + 2 Al    2 Fe + Al 2 O 3  + heat Apart from carbon, reactive metals such as sodium, calcium, aluminium are also  used as reducing agent for the reduction of metal oxide to obtain the metal. This is because   these metals displace a moderately reactive metal from  its compound. For example, when   manganese dioxide is ignited with aluminiumpowder the following reaction takes place. 3 MnO 2  + 4 Al        3Mn + 2Al 2 O 3  + heat c. Extraction of less reactive metals The metals at the bottom of the reactivity series of metals are less reactive.That is  why they are found in free state in nature. For example gold, silver, platinum. The reserves   of copper in free state are very few. Presently copper is found mainly in the form of Cu 2 S.  Copper is obtained from Cu 2 S ore just by heating in air. 2Cu 2 S + 3O 2    2 Cu 2 O + 2SO 2                                           2 Cu 2 O + Cu 2 S   6Cu + SO 2   Collect information  Slag Crucible Tapping device Mold Weld Hot steel from  thermit  reaction Rail Transverse  section   of rail 8.13 Thermit Welding Methods used for welding rails Slag Do you know ?

Refining of metals Metals obtained by the various reduction processes described above are not very pure.  They contain impurities. The impurities need to be separated to obtain pure metal.  Electrolysis method is used to obtain pure metals from impure metals. 106 Corrosion of metals 1.   What is meant by corrosion? 2.    Have you seen the following things?   Old iron bars of buildings, copper vessels not cleaned for long time,  silver ornaments  or idols exposed to air for long time, old abandoned vehicles fit to be thrown away. 1)   Why  do silver articles turn blackish while copper vessels  turn greenish on keeping in air for a long time? 2)   Why do pure gold and platinum always glitter?   Rusting of iron articles  causes large financial loss. Thus corrosion of iron, that is,  rusting is a big problem. Prevention of corrosion 1. Whichmeasures would you suggest to stop the corrosion of  metallic articles or not to allow the corrosion to start? 2. What is done so to preventrusting of iron windows and iron  doors of your house? Can you recall? Think about it Rusted shackles   Blackened  silver vessel The copper cladded  statue of Liberty made   300 years ago has   turned green. Can you tell? Various methods are used to protect metals from corrosion. Special attentionis paid  in almost all the methods so that iron does not rust. We can lower the rate of the process  of rusting of iron. Corrosion of metals can be stopped by keeping metals isolated from a  direct contact with air. The prevention of corrosion can be achieved by various ways.  Some of these methods are as follows. 1.   To fix a layer of some substance on the met al  surface so that the contact of the  metal   with  moisture and oxygen in the air is prevented and no reaction would occur  between them. 2.   To prevent corrosion of metals by applying a layer of paint, oil, grease or varnish  on their surface. For example, corrosion of iron can be prevented by this method. 8.14 Effects of corrosion 1.   Iron reacts with moist air and a deposit  of  reddish substance (Fe 2 O 3   H 2 O) is  formed on it. This substance is called  rust. 2.   Carbon dioxide in moist air reacts with  the surface of copper vessel. Copper  loses its luster due to formation of  greenish layer of copper carbonate  (CuCO 3 ) on its surface. This is called  patination of copper.    3.   On exposure to air, silver articles turn    blackish after some time. This is because   of the layer of silver sulphide (Ag 2 S)  formed by the reaction of silver with  hydrogen sulphide in air. 4. By oxidation of aluminium, a thin layer  of aluminium oxide forms on it. . 107 Can we permanently prevent the rusting of an iron  article by applying a layer of paint on its surface? 2.   Tinning  In this method a layer of molten tin is deposited on metals. We call this as ‚ kalhaee ™.A  greenish layer forms on the surface of a copper or brass vessel. This greenish layer is  poisonous. If buttermilk or curry is placed in such a vessel it gets spoiled. Tinning is done  to prevent all such damages. For example, when aluminium is  anodised, the thin layer of aluminium oxide   is formed. It obstructs the contact of the   aluminium with oxygen and water. This  prevents further oxidation.This protection  can be further increased by making the   oxide layer thicker during the anodization. 3.   Anodization  In this method metals like copper, aluminium are coated with a thin and strong layer  of their oxides by means of electrolysis. For this the copper or aluminium article is used as  anode. As this oxide layer is strong and uniform all over the surface, it is useful for  prevention of the corrosion of the metal.

If thereis  a scratch on the paint on the surface of the  article and if a small surface of the metal comes in contact with air, the process of rusting  starts below the layer of the paint. Why do new iron sheets appear shiny?  Corrosion can be preventedby putting a layer of noncorrodiblemetalon a corrodible  metal. This can be done in many ways. 1.   Galvanizing In this method a thin layer of zinc is applied to prevent corrosion of iron or steel. For  example, shining iron nails, pins, etc. In this method corrosion of zinc occurs first because  zinc is more electropositive than iron. After a few rainy seasons the zinc layer goes away  and the inner iron gets exposed. Then iron starts rusting. 108 4.   Electroplating In this methoda less reactive metalis coated  on a more reactive metal by electrolysis. Silver  platedspoons, gold platedornaments are the  examples of electroplating. 5.   Alloying Majority of the metallic substances used  presently are in the form of alloys. The main  intention behind this is to decrease the intensityof  corrosion of metals. The homogenous mixture  formed by mixing a metal with other metals or   nonmetals in certain proportion is called an alloy.   For example, bronze is an alloy formed from 90%  copper and 10 % tin. Bronze statues do not get  affected by sun and rain. Stainless steeldoes not   get stains with air or water and also does not rust.   It is an alloy made from 74% iron, 18% chromium  and 8% carbon. In recent times various types of  alloys are used for minting coins.    When one of the metals in an alloy is mercury the alloy is called amalgam. For  example, sodium amalgam, zinc amalgam, etc. Silver amalgam was earlier used by  dentists. Gold amalgam is used for extraction of gold. 1. What are the various alloys used in daily life? Where  are those used? 2. What are the properties that the alloy used for minting  coins  should  have? 1.   Write names. a.   Alloy of sodium with mercury. b.

What are the types of compounds ?   In the previous standards we have seen that organic and inorganic compounds are the  two important types of compounds.  Exceptmaterials fabricatedfrom metaland glass/soil  several other materials from foodstuff to fuels are made up of organic compounds. The   essential element in all the organic compounds is carbon. About 200 years back it was   believed that organic compounds are obtained directly or indirectly from the organisms.   However, after synthesis of the organic compound urea from an inorganic compounds in the   laboratory, the organic compounds received a new identity as carbon compounds. All the   compounds having carbon as a constituent element are called as organic compounds. The  compounds carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, carbide salts, carbonate salts and bicarbonate  salts are exception; they are inorganic compounds of carbon. Bonds in Carbon compounds   Y ou have learnt about the ionic compounds in the previous chapter. You have seen that  ionic compounds have high melting and boiling points and they conduct electricity in the molten  and dissolved state. You have also seen that these properties of ionic compounds are explained   on the basis of the ionic bonds in them. The table 9.1 shows melting and boiling points of a few   carbon compounds. Are these values higher or lower as compared to the ionic compounds? 1. What is meant by a chemical bond? 2. What is the number of chemical bonds that an  atom of an element forms called?   3.

Write down the  electronic configuration of carbon and deduce the valency of carbon. Compound Melting point  0 C Boiling point  0 C Methane (CH 4 ) Ethanol (CH 3 CH 2 OH) Chloroform (CHCl 3 ) Acetic acid (CH 3 COOH) - 183 - 117 - 64    17 - 162    78    61    118   Generally the  melting and boiling  points of carbon compounds are found to  be lower than 300  0 C. From this we  understood that the intermolecular   attractive forces are weak in carbon   compounds.   In the previous standard on testing  the electrical conductivity of carbon   compounds, glucose and urea you have   observed that they   are not electrical   conductors.  Generally most of the carbon   compounds are found to be bad conductors   of electricity. From it we understand that   structures of most of the carbon compounds   lack ionic bonds. It means that the   chemical bonds in carbon compounds do  not produce ions. 9.1 Melting and Boiling Points of a few carbon  compounds Can you recall? Can you tell? 111   In  the previous standards you have learnt about the relationship between electronic  configuration and valency of an element, and also about the ionic and covalent bonds. Let see   at the background of electronic configuration of carbon and the covalent bonds formed. (See   Table 9.2). 9.2 Background of bond formation by carbon Carbon  atom Electronic  Configuration  Number of electron in the  Valence shell Most nearby noble gas and the   electronic configuration He Ne 6 C 2, 4 4 2 2,8   You have seen that the driving force behind the formation of bond by an atom is to attain  the stable electronic configuration of the nearby noble gas and obtain stability. As the valence   shell of carbon contains 4 electrons, there can be many alternative routes to attain a noble gas   configuration.   (i) To attain the configuration of noble gas helium (He) by losing one after another all the  four valence electrons : In this method the net positive charge on the carbon atom goes on   increasing during loss of every electrons. Therefore to lose the next electron more energy is   required, which makes the task more difficult. Moreover, the  C 4+  cation that would ultimately  form in this process becomes unstable in spite of its noble gas configuration, because it has a   small size with high net charge. Therefore carbon atom does not take this route to attain a   noble gas configuration.   (ii)  To attain the stable configuration of the noble gas neon (Ne) by accepting one by one  ass the four electrons in the valence shell.  In this method the net negative charge on the   carbon atom goes on increasing while accepting every new electron. Therefore, more energy   is required for accepting the next electron by overcoming the increasing repulsive force making   the task more and more difficult. Moreover the C 4-   anion ultimately formed would be unstable  in spite of its noble gas configuration, as it would have a small size with high net charge   making it difficult for the nuclear charge +6 to hold 10 electrons around it. Therefore, carbon   atom does not take this route to attain a noble gas configuration.   (iii) To attain the configuration of neon by sharing four electrons of valence shell with  four valence electrons of other atoms: In this method two atoms share valence electrons with   each  other. Valence shells of both the atoms overlap and accommodate the shared electrons,  As a result, both the atoms attain a noble gas configuration without generating any net charge   on them, which means that atoms remain electrically neutral. Due to these factors atoms   attain stability. Therefore, carbon atom adopts this route to attain a noble gas configuration.   The chemical bond formed by sharing of two valence electrons between the two atoms is  called covalent bond.    A  covalent bond is represented clearly by drawing an electron - dot structure. In this  method a circle is drawn around the atomic symbol and each of the valence electrons is   indicated by a dot or a cross. The covalent bond formed between the atoms is indicated by   showing the circles around the atomic symbols crossing each other. The shared electrons are   shown in the overlapping regions of the two circles by dot or cross. The electron - dot structure   is also drawn without showing the circle. One pair of shared electrons constitutes one covalent   bond . A covalent bond is also represented by a small line joining the symbols of the two  atoms. The line structure  is also called structural formula.    Single bond 9.3 Electron dot structure and line structure of hydrogen molecule with a single bond H : H 112   Let us first look at the hydrogen molecule which is the simplest example of a molecule  formed by covalent bonding. Y ou have already learnt that the atomic number of hydrogen  being 1, its atom contains 1 electron in K shell. It requires one more electron to complete the  K shell and attain the configuration  of helium (He). To meet this requirement two hydrogen   atoms share their electrons with each other to form H 2  molecule. One covalent bond, that is a  single bond is formed between two hydrogen atoms by sharing of two electrons. (see fig 9.3).   The O 2  molecule is formed by chemical combination of two oxygen atoms;  and N 2  molecule is formed by the chemical combination of two nitrogen atoms. On drawing the   electron-dot structures of these two molecules, it becomes clear that the two oxygen atoms in   O 2  molecule are joined with each other by two covalent bonds, that is, a double bond, while  the two nitrogen atoms in the N 2  molecule are joined with each other by three covalent bonds,  that is, a triple bond (See figure 9.4) (Remember that it is esseantial to show all the valance  electrons in an electron dot structure.)   Now letus consider a carbon compound  methane  (CH 4 ). You have learnt about the  occurrence, properties and uses of methane   molecule in the previous standard. Just now we   saw that carbon atom forms four covalent bonds   using the four valenceelectrons and attain the   configurationof the nearby noble gas neon (Ne)   and obtains stability: Fig 9.5 shows the line   structure and also the electron-dot structure of   methane.  1 .

Similarly, we also  saw the structure of the simple carbon  compound, methane. But carbon is different   than the other elements; the number of  compounds formed from carbon is  extremely large. In the beginning we saw   that except for the objects formed from   metals and glass/soil all the other objects  are made from carbon. In short, brief the  entire living kingdom is made from carbon,   our body is also made from carbon.  Millions of molecules ranging from the  small and simple methane molecule to the   extremely big D.N.A. moleculeare made  from carbon. The molecular masses of  carbon compounds range up to 10 12 . This  means that carbon atoms come together in  a large number to form extremely big  molecules. What is the cause of this unique   property of carbon? It is due to the peculiar  nature of the covalent bonds formed by  carbon, it can form large number of   compounds. From this we come to know   the following  characteristics of carbon . a. Carbon has a unique ability to form   strong covalent bonds with other carbon   atoms; this results in formation of big  molecules. This property of carbon is called  catenation power. The carbon compounds   contain open chains or closed  chains of  carbon atoms. An open chain can be a  straight chain or a branched chain. A closed   chain is a ring structure. The covalent bond  between two  carbon atoms is strong and  therefore stable. Due to the strong and   stable covalent bonds carbon is bestowed  with catenation power.       Till  now the number of known  carbon compounds is about 10  million. This number is larger than   the total number of compounds   formed by all the other elements. The   range of molecular masses of carbon   compounds is 10 1  - 10 12 . (See table 9.7) Ball & stick  model Space filling model 1. Hydrogen peroxide decomposes  on its own by the following  reaction        H-O-O-H   2H-O-H + O 2           From this, what will be your  inference about the strength of  O-O covalent bond? 2. Tell from the above example  whether oxygen has catenation  power or not.   Use your brain power ! 114 b. Two carbon atoms can be  bonded together by one, two   or three covalent bonds.   These are called single bond,   double bond, and triple bond   respectively. Due to the   ability of carbon atoms to   form multiple bonds as well   as single bonds, the number   of carbon compounds   increases. For example,   there are three compounds,   namely,ethane(CH 3 -CH 3 ),  ethene (CH 2 =CH 2 ) and  ethyne (CH  CH)  which  contain two carbon atoms.

Being tetravalent one carbon atom can form bonds with four other atoms (carbon or any   other). This results in formation of many compounds. These compounds possess different   properties as per the atoms to which carbon is bonded. For example, five different   compounds are formed using one carbon atom and two monovalent elements hydrogen   and chlorine : CH 4 , CH 3 Cl, CH 2 Cl 2 , CHCl 3 , CCl 4 . Similarly carbon atoms form covalent  bonds with atoms of elements like O, N, S, halogen & P to form different types of carbon   compounds in large number.  d. Carbon has one more characteristicwhich is responsible for large number of carbon   compounds. It is ‚isomerism™. Shortly, we will learn about it. Hydrocarbons : Saturated and Unsaturated   Carbon compounds contain  many elements. The elementhydrogen is present to a  smaller or larger extent in majority of carbon compounds. The compounds which contain  carbon and hydrogen as the only two elements are called hydrocarbons. Hydrocarbons are   the simplest and the fundamental organic compounds. The smallest hydrocarbon is   methane (CH 4 ) formed by combination of one carbon atom and four hydrogen atoms. We  have already seen the structure of methane. Ethane is one more hydrocarbon. Its molecular   formula is C 2 H 6 .  The first step in writing the line structure (structural formula) of a  hydrocarbon is to join the carbon atoms in the molecule with single bonds, and then in the   second step use the hydrogen atoms in the molecular formula so as to fulfilthe remaining   valencies of the  tetravalent carbon atoms. (See fig. 9.8), Fig. 9.9 shows electron-dot   structure using two methods.  Ethane : Molecular formula C 2 H 6 Step 1 : Join the two carbon atoms with single bonds  C - C  Step 2 : Use the 6 hydrogen atoms in the molecular formula   for fulfilling the tetravalency of both the carbon atoms. 9.9. Electron-dot structure of ethane 115   The carbon compounds having a double bond or triple bond between two carbon atoms  are called unsaturated compounds. Ethene and ethyne are unsaturated hydrocarbons. The  unsaturated hydrocarbons containing a carbon-carbon double bond are called ‚Alkenes™. The   unsaturated hydrocarbons whose structures contain a carbon-carbon triple bond are called   ‚Alkynes™. Generally the unsaturated compounds are more reactive than the saturated   compounds. Straight chains, Branched chains and Rings of Carbon atoms   Let us compare the structural formulae of methane, ethane and propane. From these  structural formulae it is seen that the carbon atom (single or more carbon atoms bonded to  each other) lie in the core of the molecule, while the hydrogen atoms bonded to each of the   carbon atoms are on the periphery of the molecule. The mutually bonded carbon atoms in the   core are like the skeleton of the molecule. The carbon skeleton determines the shape of the   molecule of a carbon compound.    A   straight chain of carbon atoms is formed by joining the carbon atoms are next to the  other. The first column of the table 9.12 shows straight chains of carbon atoms. Write the   structural formulae of the corresponding straight chain hydrocarbons in the second column   satisfying the tetravalency of the carbon atom by joining them to hydrogen  atoms.  Work out   the molecular formula from this and write it down in the third column. The name of the   hydrocarbon is given in the fourth column.   From the  structural formula of ethane & propane it is seen that the valencies of all the  atoms are satisfied by the single bonds. Such compounds are called saturated compounds.  Ethane & propane are saturated hydrocarbons. Saturated hydrocarbons are also called  ‚Alkanes™ .   There are two more hydrocarbons that contain two carbon atoms, namely, ethene  (C 2 H 4 ) and ethyne(C 2 H 2 ). Let us see the method to draw the structural formula (line  structure) of ethene (C 2 H 4 ). (Fig 9.10)    Step 1  :  Join the two carbon atoms with single bond C-C. Step 2  : Use the 4 hydrogen atoms in the molecular formula for satisfying tetravalency of  both the carbon atoms. Molecularformula of propane is C 3 H 8  . From this draw  its structural formula. It appears that one valency of  each of the two carbon atoms is  not satisfied.  Step 3:  Satisfy the tetravalency of   the two carbon atoms by drawing  a double bond in place of the  single bond between them. 9.10  Line structure/ structural formula 9.11  Electron-dot structures           of ethane 1.

This crude oil and natural  gas are now recovered from   the oil wells. The natural gas is  mainly methane . The crude oil  is a complex mixture of  thousands of different  compounds. It mainly contains   various hydrocarbons. Various  useful components such as  CNG, LPG, petrol (gasoline),  kerosene, diesel, engine oil,  lubricant, etc. are obtained by   separation crude oil using  fractional distillation.   Now letus pay more attention to the carbon chain in  butane. The four carbon atoms can be joined to form a  carbon chain in yet another way. (See fig 9.13 a)   Two different  structural formulae are obtained on joining hydrogen atoms to these  two chains so as to satisfy the tetravalency of the carbon atoms. The molecular formula of  both these structural formulae is the same which is C 4 H 10 . These are two different  compounds as their structural formulae are different. The phenomenon in which compounds  having different structural formulae have the same molecular formula is called ‚structural  isomerism™. The number of carbon compounds increases further due to the isomerism  observed in carbon compounds. The carbon chain (i) in the figure 9.13 (a) is a straight  chain of carbon atoms, whereas the carbon chain (ii) is a branched chain of carbon atoms.   Apart from the straight chains and branched chains, closed chains of carbon atoms  are present in some carbon compounds. Wherein rings of carbon atoms form. For example,   the molecular formula of cyclohexane is C 6 H 12  and its structural formula contains a ring  of six carbon atoms. (See fig 9.14)  9.12  Straight chain hydrocarbon  b.

There are three alternate double bonds in the six membered ring structure of  benzene. The compounds having this characteristic unit in their structure are called  aromatic compounds. Functional Groups in Carbon Compounds   Till  now you have learnt about the hydrocarbon compounds formed by combination  of the elements carbon and hydrogen. Many more types of carbon compounds are formed  by formation of bonds of carbon with other elements such as halogens, oxygen, nitrogen,  sulphur. The atoms of these elements substitute one or more hydrogen atoms in the  hydrocarbon chain and thereby the tetravalency of carbon is satisfied. The atom of the   element which is substitute for hydrogen is referred to as a hetero atom. Sometimes hetero  atoms are not alone but exist in the form of certain groups of atoms. (See the table 9.16).  The compound acquire specific chemical properties due to these hetero atoms or the  groups of atoms that contain heteroatoms, irrespective of the length and nature of the  carbon chain in that compound. Therefore these heteroatoms or the groups of atoms  containing hetero atoms are called functional groups. The table 9.16 shows a few functional  groups that occurs in carbon compounds.  isobutane  C 4  H 10 isobutylene C 4  H 8 Cyclohexane C 6  H 12 118 9.16 Some functional groups in carbon compounds Homologous series   You have seen that chains of different length are formed by joining the carbon atoms  to each other. Moreover you have also seen that a functional group can take place of a  hydrogen atom on these chains. As a result of this, large number of compounds are formed  having the same functional groups but different length of carbon chain. For example, there  are many compounds such as CH 3 -OH, CH 3 -CH 2 -OH, CH 3 -CH 2 -CH 2 -OH, CH 3 -CH 2 -CH 2 - CH 2 -OH which contain alcohol as the functional group. Though the length of the carbon  chains in them is different, their chemical properties are very much similar due to the  presence of the same functional group in them. The series of compounds formed by joining  the same functional group in the place of a particular hydrogen atom on the chains having  sequentially increasing length is calledhomologous series. There are different homologous  series in accordance with the functional group. For example, homologous series of alcohols,   homologous series of carboxylicacids, homologous series of aldehydes, etc. All the  members of the homologous series are homologues of each other. Earlier you filled the  structural formulae and molecular formulae in the table 9.12. From that the initial part of   the homologous series of alkanes was formed.      Letus understand the characteristics of homologous series by considering initial parts  of homologous series of alkanes, alkenes and alcohols.  (See table No. 9.17.) Complete the table Fill in the gaps in the table 9.17 a, b and c of homologous  series.   Here the free valency of the functional group is indicated by a short line. The functional  group taking place of a hydrogen is joined to the carbon chain with this valency. The  carbon- carbon double and triple bonds  are also recognised as functional groups as the  respective compounds get specific chemical properties due to them.

Therefore,  while going in an increasing order of the length there is a rise in the molecular mass of the  members by 14 u. Inspection of the table  9.17 (a), (b) and (c) will reveal one more point to you, and that is  gradation in the boiling points. Boiling point is a physical property of a compound. Generally it   is found that, while going in an increasing order in any homologous series the physical properties  show variation in one direction, that is, a gradation is observed in the physical properties. Nomenclature systems of carbon compounds a. System of common names :  We have seen that today millions of carbon compounds are  known. Initially when the number of known carbon compounds was small, scientists named   them in a variety of ways. Now those names are calledcommon names. For example,the   sources of the names of the first four alkanes, namely methane, ethane, propane and butane   are different. The names of the alkanes thereafter were given from number of carbon atoms   in them. Two isomeric compounds having a straight chain or branched chain in their  structural formulae are possible for the molecular formula C 4 H 10 . the difference and  interrelationship in them was indicated by naming them as n-butane (normal-butane) and  i- butane (iso-butane). 1.    The table 9.17 (c) shows the homologous series of alkenes.  Inspect the molecular formulae of the members of this series.  Do you find any relationship, in the number of carbon atoms  and the number of hydrogen atoms in the molecular formulae? 2.    If the number of carbon atoms in the molecular formulae of alkenes is denoted by ‚n™ , what  will be the number of hydrogen atoms? The molecular formulae of the members of the homologous series of alkenes can be  represented by a general formula C n H 2n . When the value of ‚n™ is ‚2™. We get the molecular  formula of the first member of this series as C 2  H 2x2  , that is, C 2 H 4 . When the value of ‚n™ is ‚3™,  the molecular formula of the second member of the alkene series is obtained as C 3 H 2x3,  that is,  C 3 H 6. 1. What would be the general formula for the molecular formulae of the members of the  homologous series of alkanes? What would be the value of ‚n™ for the first member of this   series? 2. The general molecular formula for the homologous series of alkynes is C n H 2n-2  .Write   down the individual molecular formulae of the first, second and third members by substituting   the values 2,3 and 4 respectively for ‚n™ in this formula. From the above examples we come to  know the following characteristics of the homologous series. (i) While going from one member to the next in a homologous series.   (a) One methylene (-CH 2 -) unit gets added.  (b) molecular mass increases by 14 u.   (c) number of carbon atoms increases by one. (ii) Chemical properties of members of a homologous series show similarity.  (iii) All the members of a homologous series can be represented by The same a general molecular  formula. 1.Write down structural formulae of the first four  members of the various homologous series formed by  making use of the functional groups in the table 9.16 2. General formula of the homologous series of alkanes  is C n H 2n+2 . Write down the molecular formula of the    8 th  and 12 th  member using this. Use your brain power ! Use your brain power ! 121 1.    Draw three  structural formulae having molecular  formula C 5 H 12  . 2.    Give the  names n-pentane, 1(i-pentane) and neo- pentane to the above three structural formulae. (Use the same logic  as used in the names of the  isomeric butanes for this purpose.) 3.     Draw all  the  possible structural formulae having molecularformula C 6 H 14 .  Give   names to all the isomers. Which difficulties were faced by you while naming?   As the time  progressed, the carbon compounds became very large in number and their  common names  caused confusion. A need was felt to have a logical system acceptable  to all for naming the carbon compounds. IUPAC nomenclature system    International  Union for Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) put forth a nomenclature  system based on the structure of the compounds, and it was accepted all over the world.   There is a provision in this system for giving a unique name to all the carbon compounds.  Let us see how some straight chain compounds containing one functional group are given   IUPAC names and let us also see their common names.   There are three units in the IUPAC name of any carbon compound : parent, suffix and  prefix. These are arranged in the name as follows prefix - parent - suffix 9.18 IUPAC Nomenclature of straight chain compounds: step 1 Step 2 : If the structural formula contains a functional group replace the last letter ‚e™ from the parent  name by the condensed name of the functional group as the suffix. (Exception : The condensed   name of the functional group ‚halogen™ is always attached as the prefix.) (see the table 9.19)  Step 3 : Number the carbon atoms in the carbon chain from one end to the other. Assign the number   ‚1™ to carbon in the functional group -CHO or -COOH, if present, Otherwise, the chain can be  numbered in two directions. Accept that numbering which gives smaller number to the carbon  carrying the functional group. In the final name a digit (number) and a character (letter) should be   separated by a small horizontal line (See the table 9.20) (Usually numbering is not required if the  carbon chain contain only two carbon atoms)   An IUPAC name is given to a compound on the basis of the name of its parent alkane. The  name of the compound in constructed by attaching appropriate suffix and prefix to the name of the  parent alkane. The steps in the IUPAC nomenclature of straight chain compounds are as follows.  Step 1 :  Draw the structural formula of the straight chain compound and count the number of   carbon atoms in it. The alkane with the same number of carbon atoms is the parent alkane of the   concerned compound. Write the name of this alkane. In case the carbon chain of the concerned   compound contains a double bond,  change the ending of the parent name from ‚ane™ to ‚ene™. If  the carbon chain in the concerned compound contains a triple bond, change the ending of the parent  name from ‚ane™ to ‚yne™.

Complete the table by writing their IUPAC names in  the third column. 9.20  IUPAC Nomenclature : Step- 3 Some more steps are required for writing IUPAC names of compounds having more  complex structural units such as branched chains, carbon rings, heterocycles, etc. Study of  these will be included in the further standards. At the same time, also keep in mind that   thereis a practice of using commonnames of the carbon compounds which are frequently   use in the laboratory.

Write down the reactionfor complete  combustion of Propane (C 3 H 8 )  1. Combustion :   Let us first look at combustion as a  chemical property of carbon  compounds. We have seen in the previous standard that, carbon in the form of various  allotropeson ignition in presenceof oxygen undergoes combustionto emit heat and light,   and forms carbon dioxide. Hydrocarbons as well as most of the carbon compounds under    goes combustion in presence of oxygen to emit heat and light and form carbon dioxide and   water as the common products. Some of the combustion reactions are as follows.  (i)    C     +   O 2      CO 2  + heat + light   (Carbon)  (ii)    CH 4   +  2O 2     CO 2  + 2H 2 O + heat + light          (methane) (iii)   CH 3 - CH 2 - OH + 3O 2    2CO 2  + 3H 2 O + heat + light (Ethanol) Use your brain power ! 9.21 Common and IUPAC names of some carbon compounds Chemical Properties of Carbon Compounds Can you recall? 124 Apparatus :  Bunsen burner, copper gauze, metal plate, etc. Chemicals :  Ethanol, acetic acid, naphthalene Procedure :  Place one of the above chemicals (3-4 drops or a pinch) on a clean copper  gauze at room temperature, hold it on a blue flameof the Bunsen burner and observe. Is  smoke/ soot seen to form due to combustion? Hold the metal plate on the flame when the   substance is undergoing combustion. Does any deposit get collectedon the plate? Which   colour? Repeat the same procedure using other chemicals  from the above list.   In the above activity  ethanol is a saturated carbon compound, while naphthalene is an  unsaturated compound. Generally saturated carbon compounds burn with a clean blue flame   while unsaturated carbon compounds burn with a yellow flame and release black smoke. It   is this black smoke due to which a deposit of black soot got collected on the metal plate. The proportion of carbon  atoms in ethanol (C 2 H 5 OH)  and naphthalene (C 10 H 8 )   Comparison of the molecular  formulae indicates that  the proportion of carbon is larger in unsaturated  compounds than in saturated compounds. As a result,    some unburnt carbon particlesare also formed during   combustion of unsaturated compounds. While in the   flame, these hot carbon particles emit yellow light and   therefore the flame appears yellow. However, if oxygen   supply is limited a yellow flame is obtained by combustion  of saturated compounds as well.   Light a Bunsen burner. Open and close the air hole at the bottom  of the burner by means of the movable ring around it. When do you  get yellow sooty flame? When do you get blue flame?   2. Oxidation   Y ou have seen that carbon compounds start  burning by combining easily with oxygen in the  air when ignited in air. In this process of  combustion all the chemical bonds in the molecule  of the carbon compound break and CO 2  and H 2 O  are formed as the products. In other words the  carbon compounds is completely oxidised during  combustion. Chemical compounds can also be   used as source of oxygen. Substances that can  give oxygen to other substances are called  oxidants or oxidizing agents. Potassium   permanganate or potassium dichromate are  commonly used as oxidizing agents. An oxidising  agents affects on certain functional groups in  present carbon compounds.  Apparatus  : Test tube, Bunsen burner, measuring cylinder, dropper, etc. Chemicals :    Ethanol, dilute solution of sodium carbonate, dilute  solution of potassium permanganate. Procedure  : Take 2-3 ml ethanol in a test tube, add 5 ml sodium carbonate solution to it and warm  the mixture by holding the test tube on the burner for a while. Do dropwise addition of a dilute  solution of potassium permanganate to this warm mixture with stirring. Does the typical pink   colour of potassium permanganate stay as it is on addition ? Does the pink colour stop vanishing   and stays on after some time of the addition process?   There are inlets for air in the  gas or kerosene stove at home. It is  because of these air inlets that the  gaseous fuel is mixed with sufficient  oxygen and a clean blue flame is   obtained. In case there is deposition  of black soot on the bottom of  cooking vessels it is an indication   of choking of the air inlets and   therebythe wastage of fuel. In such  case the air inlets of the stove  should be got cleaned. Always remember Try this. Try this. Try this. Compare 125   In  the above activity ethanolgets oxidised by alkaline potassium permanganate to  form ethanoic acid. Only certain bonds in the vicinity of the functionalgroup take part in   this reaction. The following equation will explain this.     On adding the pink coloured solution of potassium permanganate to ethanol, the pink  colour disappears in the beginning.This is because potassium permanganate is used up in   the oxidation reaction. At a certain point of the addition, oxidation of all the quantity of   ethanol in the test tube is complete.If the addition of potassium permangnate is continued   beyond this point, it is not used up and becomes excess. The pink colour of this excess   potassium  permangnate does not vanish but stays as it is. 3. Addition Reaction  Chemicals  : Tincture iodine, bromine water, liquefied Vanaspati ghee, various vegetable  oils (peanut, safflower, sunflower, olive, etc.) Procedure  : Take 4 ml oil in a test tube and add 4 drops of tincture iodine or bromine  water in it. Shake the test tube. Find out whether the original colour of bromine or iodine  disappears or not. Repeat the same procedure using other oils and Vanaspati ghee.   In the above activit y, the observation of the disappearing /diminishing colour of  bromine / iodine indicates that bromine / iodine is used up. This means that bromine/   iodine has undergone a reaction with the concerned substance. This reaction is an ‚addition   reaction™. When a carbon compound combines with another compound to form a product   that contain all the atoms in both the reactants, it is called an addition reaction. Unsaturated   compounds contains a multiple bond as theirfunctional group. They undergo addition   reaction to form a saturated compound as the product. The addition reaction of an   unsaturated compound with iodineor bromine takes place instantaneouslyat room   temperature. Moreover the colour change can be felt by eyes. therefore this reaction is   used as a test for detection of a multiple bond in a carbon compound. In the above activity,   the colour of iodine / bromine disappears in the reaction between an oil and iodine,   however, there is no colour change with Vanaspati ghee. What inference will you draw  from this? Which of the substances do contain a multiple bond? How is the transformation of   ethanol into ethanoic acid an   oxidation reaction? Compare Try this.

However, it is necessary to use a catalystlike platinum or nickel  for this  reaction. We have already seen that catalyst is such a substance due to presence  of which rate of reaction changes without  causing any  disturbance to it.     In the  chlorination, substitution reaction of propane  two isomeric products containing one chlorine atom are  obtained. Draw their structural formulae and give their  IUPAC names.   You have learnt about four types of common reactions in the previous chapter. In  which of these four types the addition and substitution reaction of carbon compounds can   be included? What are the additional details and difference in the addition and substitu - tion reaction?    This reaction is used for hydrogenation of  vegetableoils in presence of nickel  catalyst. You  have seen in the above activity that iodine  test  indicates presence of multiple bonds (double bond in   particular) in the molecules of oils while Vanaspati  ghee is found to be saturated. The molecules of  vegetable oil contain long and unsaturated carbon   chains. Hydrogenation  transforms them into   saturated chains and thereby Vanaspati ghee is  formed.   Unsaturated fats containing  double bonds are healthy while saturated fats are harm - ful to health. 4. Substitution reaction   As  the single bonds C-H and C-C are very strong, the saturated hydrocarbons are not  reactive,and therefore they remain inert in presence of most reagents. However, saturated  hydrocarbons, in presence of sunlight react rapidly with chlorine.In this reaction chlorine  atoms replace, one by one, all the hydrogen atoms in the saturated hydrocarbon. The  reaction in which the place of one type of atom / group in a reactant is taken by another  atom / group of atoms, is called substitutionreaction. Chlorination of methane, is a   substitution reaction which gives four products.  Use your brain power !

Sunlight Sunlight Sunlight 127 Important carbon compounds : Ethanol and Ethanoic Acid   Ethanol  and ethanoic acid are two of the commercially important carbon compounds.  Let us now learn more about them.   At room temperatur e colourless ethanol is a liquid and its boiling point is 78  0 C.  Generally ethanol is called alcohol or spirit. Ethanol is soluble in water in all proportions.  When aqueous solution of ethanol is tested with litmus paper it is found to be neutral.  Consumption of small quantity of dilute ethanol shows its effect, even though is condemned  still it has remainedsocially widespread practice.Consumption of alcohol  harms health  in a number of ways. It adversely  affects the physiological processes  and the central   nervous system. Consumption of even a small quantity of pure ethanol (called absolute  alcohol) can be lethal.Ethanol being good solvent, it is used in medicines such as tincture  iodine (solution of iodine and ethanol), cough mixture and also in many tonics.   Chemical properties of ethanol   Y ou have learnt about the oxidation reaction of  ethanol in a previous unit of this chapter. Two more   reactions of ethanol are as follows. The functional  group -OH plays an important role in the reactions  of ethanol. (i) Reaction with sodium  2Na + 2 CH 3 -CH 2 - OH        2 CH 3 -CH 2 -ONa + H 2    All  the alcohols react with sodium metalto  liberate hydrogen gas and form sodium alkoxide  salts. In the reaction of ethanol with sodium metal,  hydrogen gas and sodium ethoxide are formed as  products.  Note : This activity should be demonstrated by the teacher. Methanol (CH 3 OH), the lower  homologue of ethanol, is  poisonous, and intake of its  small quantity can affect  vision and at times can be  lethal. To prevent the misuse   of the important commercial  solvent ethanol, it is mixed  with the poisonous methanol.   Such ethanol is called  denatured spirit. A blue dye is  also added to it, so that it is  easily recognised. Do you know ? Try this. (Sodium ethoxide) Apparatus  : Big test tube, delivery tube fitted in a rubber cork, knife, candle, etc. Chemicals  : Sodium metal, ethanol, magnesium ribbon, etc. Procedure  : Take 10 ml ethanol in a big test tube. Cut sodium metal into 2-3 pieces of a  cereal grain size. Put the sodium pieces into the ethanol in the test tube and fix the gas  delivery tube to the test tube. Take a burning candle near the outlet of the gas delivery tube   and observe. 1. Which is the combustible gas coming out of the gas delivery tube?  2. Why do the sodium pieces appear to dance on the surface of ethanol? 3. Repeat the above procedure using magnesium ribbon instead of sodium. 4. Do you see gas bubble released from the piece of magnesium ribbon? 5. Does magnesium metal react with ethanol? 128   In  previous standard you have learnt that a moderately reactive metal such as  magnesium reacts with strong acid to liberate hydrogen gas. Though ethanol is neutral, it   reacts with sodium metal and liberates hydrogen gas. Sodium being highly reactive metal,   it reacts with the neutral functional group -OH of ethanol. (ii) Dehydration reaction  : When ethanol is heated at the temperature 170  0 C with excess  amount of concentrated sulphuric acid, one molecule of water is removedfrom its molecule  to form ethene, an unsaturated compound.  CH 3 -CH 2 -OH       CH 2 =CH 2   + H 2 O conc. H 2 SO 4 170 0 C    Here, concentrated sulphuric acid acts as a   dehydrating agent.  1. Explain by writing a reaction, what will happen when pieces  of sodium metal are put in n- propyl alcohol. 2. Explain by writing a reaction, which product will be formed  on heating n - butyl alcohol with concentrated sulphuric acid. Science box :   Alcohol : A fuel   The sugarcane plant transforms solar energy into chemical  energy very efficiently.  When molasses, obtained during production of sugar from sugarcane, is subjected to   fermentation, alcohol(ethanol) is obtained. On combustionin sufficient air ethanol   gives carbon dioxide and water as the only products. In this way, ethanol is a clean fuel.   Therefore in some countries it is used as an additive to increase the efficiencyof petrol.   Such a fuel is called gasohol.  Ethanoic acid:  Ethanoic acid is a colourless liquid with boiling point118 0 C. Ethanoic  acid is commonly known as acetic acid. Its aqueous solution is acidic and turns blue  litmus red. Vinegar, which is used as preservative in pickles, is a 5-8 % aqueous solution   of acetic acid. The melting point of pure ethanoic acid is  17 0 C. As a result during winter  in cold countries ethanoic acid freezes at room temperature itself and looks like ice.   Therefore it is named ‚glacial acetic acid™. Apparatus:  Glazed tile, glass rods, pH paper, blue litmus paper. Chemicals :  Dilute ethanoic acid, dilute hydrochloric acid 9.23 Testing ethanoic acid & Hydrochloric acid Procedure:   Place two strips of blue litmus paper on a glazed tile.Put one drop of dilute  hydrochloric acid on one strip with the help of a glass rod. Put one drop dilute ethanoic   acid with the help of another glass rod on the other strip. Note the colour change taken   place in the litmus strip. Repeat the same procedure using strips of pH paper. Note all the   observation in the following table.

Which indicator paper out of blue litmus paper and  pH paper is useful to distinguish between ethanoic  acid and hydrochloric acid? Chemical Properties of ethanoic Acid   Ethanoic  acid contain carboxylic acid as its functional group. The chemicalreaction  of ethanoic acid are mainly due to this functional group. i. Reaction with base a. A reaction with strong base   Ethanoic  acid gives neutralization reaction with a strong base sodium hydroxide to  form a salt and water.

Chemicals :  Acetic acid , sodium carbonate powder, freshly prepared lime water. 130   In this  activity ethanoicacid reacts with the basic salt, namely, sodium carbonate, to  form a salt , named sodium ethanoate, water and carbon dioxide gas.   The CO 2  gas of the effervescence passes through the gas delivery tube and reacts with  the lime water in the small test tube. ‚Lime water turning milky™ is the test of carbon diox - ide gas.

When an ester is  reactedwith the alkali sodium hydroxide, the corresponding alcohol and carboxyclic acid   (in the form of its sodium salt) are obtained back. This reaction is called saponification   reaction, as it is used for preparation of soap from fats.       Ester + Sodium hydroxide                 Sodium Carboxylate + Alcohol When fat is heated with sodium hydroxide solution,  soap and glycerin are formed. Which functional groups   might be present in fat and glycerin? What do you   think? 1. What are the chemical names of the nutrients that we get from  the food stuffs namely cereals, pulses and meat?  2. What are the chemical substances that make cloth, furniture  and elastic objects? Macro molecules and Polymers Macromolecules  : We have seen in the beginning of this chapter that the number of the  known carbon compounds is as large as about 10 million, and the range of their molecular  masses is as large as 10 1 - 10 12 . The number of constituent atoms is very large for the  molecules with high molecular mass. The giant carbon molecules formed from  hundreds   of thousands of atoms are called macromolecules. They are from the type of compounds   called polymers. Natural macromolecules  : The natural macromolecules namely, polysaccharides,  proteins and nucleic acids are the supporting pillars of the living world. We get food,   clothing and shelter from polysaccharides, namely, starch and cellulose. Proteins constitute   a large part of the bodies of animals and also are responsible for their movement and   various physiological processes. Nucleic acids control the heredityat molecular level.   Rubber is another type of natural macromolecule. Manmade macromolecules  : Macromolecules were produced for the first time in the  laboratory and factory with an intention to invent an alternative for rubber and silk. Today   manmade macromolecules are in use in every walk of life. Manmade fibres which have   strength along the length similar to natural fibres cotton, wool and silk; elastomers which   have the elastic property of rubber; plastics from which innumerable types of articles,    sheets, pipes and surface coatings are made are all examples of  manmade macromolecules.   The structure of natural and  manmade macromolecules is formed by joining several small   units in a regular manner. As a result the macromolecules are polymeric in nature. Polymers  : A macromolecule formed by regular repetition of a small unit is called polymer.  The small unit that repeats regularly to form a polymer is called monomer. The reaction   by which monomer molecules are converted into a polymer is called polymerization.   One important  method of polymerization is to make a polymer by joining alkene type  monomers.  For example, synthesis of polyethylene is as shown further (see 9.26). Also,   the table  9.27 shows the polymers used in large scale. Use your brain power !

These are called homopolymers. The other type of polymers are formed from two or more  monomers. They are called copolymers. For example, PET is poly ethylene terephthalate.   The structures of polymers are linear as in the above examples or they are branched and   cross linkedas well. Polymers acquire various propertiesas per the nature of the monomers   and the type of structure.

Space Missions     Man has always been curious about unknown places and he has always been eager  to expand the horizons of his knowledge by exploring the unknown world. He must have  had deep curiosity about the space and the many twinkling stars in the dark sky. He must  have had dreams to fly to the space and must have been working for that. Space missions   Substantial developments  in technology, specially space technology, in the later half  of twentiethcentury resulted in the development of space crafts making space voyage  possible. Since then, more than a thousand artificial satellites have been placed into orbits  around the earth. Additionally, space missions have been undertaken for close observation  of various objects in our solar system. We will learn about all this in this chapter.   We can classify the space missions into two categories. In one type of missions, the  objective is to put artificial satellites in orbits around the earth for research and various   other useful applications. The objective of second type of missions is to send the spacecrafts  to outer space for close observations and understanding of the objects in solar system, or  even outside the solar system.   The first person to go into the space in a spacecraft was Yuri  Gagarin of the then USSR. He orbited the earth in 1961. The first  person to step on the Moon (1969) was Neil Armstrong of USA.   Rakesh Sharma of India orbited the earth in 1984 in a Russian   spacecraft. Kalpana Chawla and Sunita Williams of Indian origin   also participated in space explorations through missions organized   by NASA (National Aeronautics and Space Administration) of USA.

Today, we can contact a person in   any part of the world within a  second. We can gather information  about worldwide events sitting at   home. You all know the importance   of internet.  Due to internet, every  information is available at our  fingertips.

It is also possible to explore the fossil reserves  and  minerals in the earth. Thus, there are unlimited applications of space missions. Today,  space technology is an inevitable part for development of a nation.  Artificial satellite      A natural satellite is an astronomicalobject orbiting the earth or any other planet.  The moon is the only natural satellite of the earth. Some other planets in the solar system  have more than one natural satellites. Similarly if a manmade object revolves around the  earth or any other planet in a fixed orbit it is called an artificial satellite (fig 10.1).      The  first artificial satellite  ‚Sputnik™  was sent to  space by Soviet Union in 1957(see figure 10.2). Today,   more than thousand satellites are orbiting the earth. The  satellites work on solar energy. So, solar photovoltaic  panels are attached on both sides of these satellites like  wings. Instruments are installed in the satellites to   receive and transmit signals from and to the earth.    The satellites have various other types of instruments, depending on their functions.  One such satellite is shown in figure 10.1. Signals transmitted from the earth to the satellite   and from  the satellite to a mobile tower and mobile phone are also shown. These satellites  are sent into the space to perform various functions. Depending on their functions, satellites  are classified into following categories: 137 Orbits of Artificial Satellites    All  artificial satellites do not revolve in similarorbits around the earth. The functions  of the satellite decidethe height of the satellite™s orbit from the earth™s surface, the nature  of the orbit (circular/elliptical) and whether the orbit shall be parallel to equator or making  some angle with it. To put the satellite in its proper orbit at specific height above the  earth™s surface, the satellite is taken to that height using a satellite launcher. Then the  satellite is given a specific velocity known as the critical velocity (v c ) in a tangential  Type of satellite Function of the satellite The names of Indian  satellite series and   their launch vehicles Weather satellite Study and prediction of weather.

The  formula for the velocity v c  can be derived as  below. If a satellite of mass ‚m™ is revolving  around the earth in an orbit of height ‚h™ with   speed ‚v c ™, then as seen in the chapter on  ‚Gravitation™, a centripetal force  mv c 2   r will  act on it. Here, ‚r™ is the orbital radius of the satellite  from the centre of the earth. 10.3 Orbit of an artificial satellite Satellite . Satellite™s  orbit R r Vc Earth 1.https://youtu.be/cuqYLHaLB5M 2. https://youtu.be/y37iHU0jK4s Watch and share  with others Internet is my friend h 138 High Earth Orbits : (Height from the earth™s surface  > 35780 km)  Medium Earth Orbit (height above the earth™s surface 2000 km to 35780 km) If the height of the satellite orbit above the earth™s surface is in between 2000 km and  35780 km, the orbits are called medium earth orbits. The geostationary satellites orbit  above the equator. These are, therefore, not useful in the study of polar regions. For this   purpose, elliptical medium earth orbits passing over the polar region are used. These orbits  are called polar orbits. In these orbits, the satellites complete one revolution in 2 to 24  hours. Some of these satellites revolve in circular orbits at  a height of around 20,200 km  above the earth™s surface. Global positioning satellites revolve in such orbits. Low Earth Orbits (height above the earth™s surface: 180 km to 2000 km) If the height of the satellite orbit above the earth™s surface is in between 180 km and  2000 km, the orbits are called  Low earth Orbits. The satellites used for scientific  experimentsand atmospheric studies revolve in low earth orbits. Depending on the height  of their orbits, they complete one revolution in around 90 minutes. International Space  Station and Hubble telescope also revolve in Low earth Orbits.  Figure 10.4 shows various orbits of satellites.   It can be seen that the critical  velocity does not depend on the mass of the satellite. As  the height of the satellite™s orbit from the earth™s surface increases, the critical velocity   decreases. Depending on the height of the satellite™s orbit above the earth™s surface, the  satellite orbits are classified as below: G = Gravitational constant  = 6.67 × 10 -11  N m 2 /kg 2 M = Mass of the earth = 6 × 10 24  kg R = Radius of the earth = 6.4 × 10 6  m = 6400 km h = Height of the satellite above earth surface   R + h = Radius of the orbit of satellite.   This centripetal force is provided by the gravity of the earth.   Therefore, centripetal  force=gravitational force between the Earth and the satellite. mv c 2 R+h =   GMm (R+h) 2     GM   R+h v c 2  = GM R+h v c  =                             .......... (1)    If the height of the satellite™s orbit above the earth™s surface is greater than or equal  to 35780 km, the orbit is called High earth Orbit. As we will see in the next solved example,  a satellite revolving in an orbit 35780 km above the earth™s surface, will take around 24  hours to complete one revolution. We know, that the earth also takes almost 24 hrs for one  revolution. If the satellite is revolving in an orbit parallel to the equator, the time of revolution  for the earth around itself and that for the satellite to revolve around the earth being the  same, the satellite will appear to be stationary with respect to the earth. For a passenger in   one vehicle, another vehicle, moving parallel to him with equal velocity, appears to be  stationary. This is what happens here also. These satellites are, therefore, called  geosynchronous satellites. Since, these satellites are stationary with reference to the earth,   they can observe a specific portion of the earth, continuously. Therefore, they are used in  applications like meteorology and for carrying signals for telephone, television, radio etc. 139 A group of students from COEP  (College of Engineering, Pune) made a  small satellite and sent it to the space  through ISRO in 2016. The name of the  satellite is ‚Swayam™ and it weighs around  1 kg. It is orbiting the earth at a height of  515 km. The main objective of the satellite   was to provide point to point messaging  services using a special method.   10.4 Orbits of satellites LEO HEO MEO GM R+h v =  (6.67 x 10 -11  ) x ( 6 x 10 24 )       42180  × 10 3  m  =  Example 2.  In the previous example, how  much time the satellite will take to complete  one revolution around the earth? Given:  Height of the satellite above the  earth™s surface= 35780 km. Velocity of the satellite=3.08 km/sec Solution:  Suppose, the satellite takes T  seconds to completeone revolution around  the earth. The distance travelled during this   one revolution is equal to the circumference  of the circular orbit. If r is the radius of the  orbit, the satellite will travel a distance 2 r  during one revolution. Thus, the time  required for one complete revolution can  be obtained as follows: v =                =  distance time circumference time         =  2   r   T =  23.89 hrs.  = 23 hrs 54 M. 40.02 x 10 13 42180 x 10 3  =  40.02 42180  =  × 10 10 = 0.0009487909  × 10 10 = 9487909 = 3.08 km/s v = 3080.245 m/s 2 × 3.14 × (6400 + 35780)              3.08 = 86003.38 sec = (Here, since the velocity is taken in the unit of  km/s, the radius is also taken in unit of km) T  =                     2  (R+h)         v 2  r    v = Solved Example Do you know ? Example 1 . Suppose the orbit of a satellite  is exactly 35780 km above the earth™s  surface. Determine the tangential velocity  of the satellite. Given :  G = 6.67 × 10 -11   N m 2 /kg 2   ,  M = 6×10 24  kg (for earth) R = 6400  km (for earth) = 6.4 × 10 6  m ,  h = height of the satellite above the earth™s    surface 35780 km.  v = ? R + h = 6400 + 35780 = 42180 × 10 3  m MEO 140 engine in the first stage are used. This imparts a specific  velocity to the vehicle and takes it to a certain height.  Once the fuel in this first stage is exhausted, the empty   fuel tank and the engine are detached from the main   body of the vehicle and fall either into a sea or on an   unpopulated land. As the fuel in the first stage is   exhausted, the fuel in the second stage is ignited.   However, the vehicle now contains only one (i.e. the  second) stage. The weight now being reduced, the vehicle  can move with higher speed. Almost all vehicles are   made of either two or more stages. As an example, the   structure of a Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV)   developed by ISRO of India is shown in fig 10.5a. Place for  satellite Forth stage using   liquid fuel Third stage   using solid fuel Second stage   using  liquid   fuel First stage   using solid fuel Engine using   solid fuel  which provides  the initial thrust 10.5 a.  Structure of PSLV  made by ISRO   The launch vehicles are costly, because they can be used only once. USA has, there - fore, developed space shuttle(fig 10.5b) which returns to the earth except for the fuel tank  and can be reused in multiple launches. Satellite Launch Vehicles   Satellite launch vehicles are used, to place the satellites in their specific orbits. The  functioning of the satellite launch vehicle is based on the Newton™s third law of motion. The  launch vehicle uses specific type of fuel. The gas produced due to combustion of the fuel   expands due to its high temperature and is expelled forcefully through the nozzles at rear side   of the launch vehicle. As a reaction of this, a thrust acts on the vehicle, which drives the   vehicle high in to the space.  The structure of the launch vehicle is decided by the weight of the satellite and the type  of satellite orbit. The fuel of the vehicle also depends on these factors. The fuel forms a major   portion of the total weight of the launch vehicle. Thus, the vehicle has to carry a large weight   of the fuel with it. To overcome this problem, launch vehicles with more than one stage are   used. Due to this, the weight of the vehicle can be reduced step by step, after its launching. For   example, consider a launch vehicle having two stages. For launching the vehicle, the fuel and   Space shuttle Separation of  booster  rockets Separation of  fuel tank  Satellite is launched in  its orbit and space   shuttle returns to earth 10.5  b. Space shuttle 141   The ‚rocket™, a type of fire-cracker  used in Diwali, is also a sort of launcher. In this  rocket, the fuel is ignited using a fuse and the rocket is projected into the sky just like a  satellite launcher. Similarly, if a balloon is blown and released with its end open, the  air in the balloon is forcefully ejected and the balloon is pushed in opposite direction.  This can be explained using the Newton™s third law of motion. Space missions away from earth    As we have seen above, artificial satellites are being used for making our life more  and more enriched. However, in the previous standard, we have learnt about how the tel - escopes aboard artificial satellites are used to gather information about various objects in   the universe. Similarly some space missions are used to gain further knowledge about the  universe. In these missions, spacecrafts are sent to the nearby objects in the solar system  to observe them more closely. New information has been obtained from such missions and   it is helping us to understand the creation and evolution of our solar system. For such missions, the spacecrafts must escape the earth™s gravitational force to travel  into the outer space. To achieve this, the initial velocity of the moving object must be   greater than the escape velocity of the earth as we have learnt in the Chapter on Gravity.  Escape velocity on  a  planet can be obtained using following formula : 2 GM   R v esc  =  G = Gravitational constant = 6.67    10 -11  N m 2 /kg 2 M = mass of the planet = 6  10 24  kg (for earth) R = Radius of the planet = 6.4    10 6  m (for earth) 2 x 6.67 x 10 -11  x 6 x 10 24         6.4 x 10 6   v esc  =  = 11.18 x 10 3  m/s  =  11.18 km/s   Thus, if a spacecraft is to escape the earth™s gravitational force to travel to the outer  space, it must have minimum velocity of 11.2 km/s.   The  astronomical object closest to us is the  moon. Light takes 1s to reach from moon to the  earth. It means that if we travel with the speed of  light, it will take 1s to reach the moon. However,  since a spacecraft travels at much smaller speed, it  takes longer time to reach the moon. The shortest  time taken by a spacecraft to reach the moon, so   far, is 8 hours and 36 minutes.  Always Remember Do you know ? 142 Missions to other planets Many missions have been executed to study other planets also. In some of these missions  the space crafts orbited the planets, some landed on the planets and some just passed near  the planet and observed them. Additionally, spacecrafts have been sent to observe asteroids   and comets and they have successfully collected some dust and stones from the asteroids   and brought them back on the earth. We are getting very useful information from all these  missions clarifying our concepts about the origin and evolution of the solar system. Moon missions   Since the moon is the closest astronomical object to us, the first space missions to objects  in the solar system were the missions to the moon. Such missions have so far been executed by  USA, Soviet Union, European countries, China, Japan and India. The space crafts in the Luna   series sent by Soviet Union reached near the moon. Luna 2, launched in 1959 was first such   craft. After that, till 1975, 15 space crafts made chemical analysis of the moon and also   measured its gravity, density and radiations. Last four crafts even landed on the moon and   brought the samples of stones on the moon for analysis in the laboratories. All these missions  were unmanned.  America also executed moon missions from 1962 to 1972. The specialty of these missions  was that some of these were manned missions. In July, 1969, Neil Armstrong became the first  human to step on the moon. In 2008, Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) successfully   launched Chandrayaan- 1 and placed it an into an orbit around the moon. It sent useful   information to earth for about a year. The most important discovery made during the mission   was the presence of water on the moon surface. India was the first country to discover this.   Mars missions   Next to the moon, the astronomical object nearest to the earth is the Mars. Many nations  sent space crafts to the Mars. Mars mission is difficult and almost half the missions were   unsuccessful. However, ISRO™s performance in this mission is remarkable and we all must be   proud of it.  The spacecraft ‚ Mangalyaan ™ made by ISRO using minimum expenses was launched  in November, 2013 and was placed into orbit around the Mars in September, 2014. It obtained   very useful information about the surface of the Mars and  the atmosphere around it.    Rakesh  Sharma was  the first Indian to travel to  space. He went into space   along with two Russian   astronauts under the joint        Indo - USSR space   programme. He stayed in   space for 8 days.   Sunita Williams  travelled to the international   space station in space   shuttleDiscovery in 2006.   She worked for 29 hrs   outside the space station.   She createda record by   staying for 192 days in   space.   Kalpana Chawla obtained  her Engineering in Aeronautics  degree from Punjab and in 1988  obtained her doctorate from  University of Colorado. She was   in space for 336 hrs during research  mission. While returning to earth  from space, on 1 st  February, 2003,  the Columbia space craft exploded  and Kalpana perished.

It includes, non-functional satellites, parts of the launcherdetachedduring launching  and debris generated due to collision of satellite with other satellite or any other object in the   space. According  to one estimation made in 2016, there are about 2 crore pieces of length   more than 1 cm, revolving around the earth! All this is nothing but the debris in space.  This debris can be harmful to the artificial satellites. It can collide with these satellites  or space crafts and damage them. This debris is increasing day by day. Soon, it will be   difficult to launch new spacecrafts. It is, therefore, very essential to manage the debris.  Some studies and experiments are being done with this in  view. Hope that soon we will  have a solution for this problem and the future satellites and spacecrafts will not be in   danger any more.   Vikram Sarabhai is considered as the father of Indian space  program. His efforts led to foundation of Physical Research Laboratory  (PRL) at Ahmedabad. In 1962, Indian government constituted ‚Indian   National Committee for Space Research™ under his Chairmanship   and first satellite launch center was established at Thumba in 1963.   The launching of India™s first satellite ‚Aryabhatta™ into the space,   was the result of his efforts. He played an important role in the   establishment of Indian Space Research Organization  (ISRO).

PSLV and GSLV are  two important launchers.    The scientific and technological feats achieved by India in this field have a significant   contributionto the national and social development. INSAT and GSAT satellite series is   actively working in the field of telecommunication, television broadcasting and   meteorological services. Availability of television, telephone and internet services all over   the nation has been possible due to these satellites only. EDUSAT satellitein this series is   used specially in the field of education. IRS satellite series is working for monitoring and  management of natural resources and disaster management. To exactly locate position of  any place on the earth™s surface in terms of its precise latitude and longitude, the IRNSS   satellite series has been established. Introduction to scientists 144 1.   Fill in the blanks and explain the       statements with reasoning: a.    If the height of the orbit of a satellite  from the earth surface is increased,  the tangential velocity of the satellite   will – b.   The initial velocity (during  launching) of the Managalyaan,   must be greater than ––––..of   the earth. 2.   State with reasons whether the  following sentences are true or false a.    If a spacecraft has to be sent away  from the influence of earth™s  gravitational field, its velocity must   be less than the escape velocity. b.    The escape velocity on the moon is  less than that on the earth. d.    A satellite needs a specific velocity    to revolve in a specific orbit. e.    If the height of the orbit of a satellite  increases, its velocity must also   increase. 3.    Answer the following questions: a.    What is meant by an artificial  satellite? How are the satellites   classified based on their functions? b.    What is meant by the orbit of a  satellite? On what basis and how are  the orbits of artificial satellites   classified? c.    Why are geostationary satellites not    useful for studies of polar regions? d.    What is meant by satellite launch  vehicles? Explain a satellite launch   vehicle developed by ISRO with the   help of a schematic diagram. e.    Why it is beneficial to use satellite  launch vehicles made of more than    one stage?  5.    Solve the following problems.   a.  If mass of a planet is eight times the  mass of the earth and its radius is  twice the radius of the earth, what   will be the escape velocity for that  planet?               Ans : 22.4 km/s b.     How much time a satellite in an orbit   at height 35780 km above earth™s sur - face would take, if the mass of the   earth would have been four times its   original mass?      Ans : ~ 12 hrs c.  If the height of a satellite completing  one revolution around the earth in T   seconds is h 1  meter, then what would  be the height of a satellite taking                        seconds for one revolution?      Ans : R + 2h 1   1.    Collect information about the space  missions undertaken by Sunita  Williams. 2.
