Heredity and hereditary changes
 
Y
ou know that heredity is the transfer of biological characters from one generation to 
another via genes. Gregor Johann Mendel is pioneer of the modern genetics. It took a long 
time to understand the conclusions of his research about heredity.  In 1901, the reasons behind 

the sudden changes were understood due to the mutational theory of Hugo de Vries. Meanwhile 

in 1902, Walter Sutton observed the paired chromosomes in the cells of grasshopper; until 

then it was not known to anyone. Research started in the direction of finding the nature of 

genetic material when it was proved that genes are carried via chromosomes. Through which 

1944, trio of scientists Oswald Avery, Mclyn McCarty and Colin McLeod proved that except 

viruses, all living organisms have DNA as genetic material.
 
In 
1961, the French geneticists Francois Jacob and Jack Monod proposed a modelfor 
process of protein synthesis with the help of DNA in bacterial cells. It helped to uncover the 

genetic codes hidden in DNA. Thereby, the technique of recombinant DNA technology 

emerged which has vast scope in the field of genetic engineering.
 
The science of heredity is useful for diagnosis, treatment 
and prevention of hereditary 
disorders, production of hybrid varieties of animals and plants and in industrial processes in 

which microbes are used.
Transcription, Translation and Translocation
 
W
ith the help of RNA, the genes present in the form of DNA participate in the functioning 
of cell and thereby control the structure and functioning of the body. Information about protein 
synthesis is stored in the DNA and synthesis of appropriateproteins as per requirement is 

necessary for body. These proteins are synthesized by DNA through the RNA. This is called 

as ‚Central Dogma™. mRNA is produced as per the sequence of nucleotides on DNA. Only one 

of the two strands of DNA is used in this process. The sequence of nucleotidesin mRNA being 

produced is always complementary to the DNA strand used for synthesis. Besides, there is 

uracil in RNA instead of thymine of DNA.  This process of RNA synthesis is called as 

‚transcription™.

The mRNA
 formed in nucleus comes in 
cytoplasm. It brings in the coded message 
from DNA. The message contains the codes 

for amino acids. The code for each amino 

acid consists of three nucleotides. It is called 

as ‚triplet codon™. 
 
Dr Har Govind Khorana, a scientist 
of 
Indian origin has made an important 

contribution in discovery of triplet codons 

for 20 amino acids. For this work, he has 

been awarded with the Nobel Prize in 1968, 

along with two other scientists. 
 
Each mRNA
 is made up of thousands of 
triplet codons. As per the message on mRNA, 

amino acids are supplied by the tRNA. For 

this purpose, tRNA has ‚anticodon™ having 

complementary sequenceto the codon on 

mRNA. This is called as ‚translation™. The 

amino acids brought in by tRNA are bonded 

together by peptide bonds with the help of 

rRNA. During this process, the ribosome 

keeps on moving from one end of mRNA to 

other end by the distance of one tripletcodon. 

This is called as ‚translocation™. Such many 

chains come together to form complex 

proteins. These proteins control various 

functions in the body of living organisms 

and their appearance too.
 
Living organisms can produce new 
individuals like themselves due to genes 

only and some of those genes are transmitted 

to the next generation without any changes. 

Due to this, some of the characters of parents 

are transmitted to their offsprings. However, 

sometimes sudden changes occur in those 

genes. Sometimes, any nucleotide of the 

gene changes its position that causes a minor 

change which is nothing but the ‚mutation™.

4. Why are many species of animals and birds getting extinct?
 
3.5 billion years ago, life had been non 
existent on the Earth. At the beginning, there 
may have been only simple elements in the 
ocean on the Earth and simple type of organic 

and inorganic compounds may have been 

formed from those. Complex compounds like 

proteins and nucleic acids may have formed 

over the long period from those simple 

compounds. First primitive type of cells may 

have been formed from the mixture of different 

types of organic and inorganic compounds. 

Number of those cells may have increased at 

the cost of surrounding chemicals. There may 

had been some differences among those cells 

and according to the principle of natural 

selection, some may have shown good growth 

and some may have perished which could not 

adjust with the surrounding.
 
At present, crores of species of plants and 
animals with huge diversity regarding shape 

and complexity are present on the Earth. 

Animal diversity ranges from the unicellular 

Amoeba
 and 
Paramecium
 to man and giant 
whale. The plant diversity consists of various 

species ranging from unicellular 
Chlorella
 to 
the huge banyan tree. The life exists on Earth 

everywhere from equator to both the poles. 

Organisms are present at all the places like 

air, water, land, rock, etc. Humans have 

shown curiosity about origin of life and 

reasons for such a great diversity in life 

present on the Earth since ancient period. 

Different theories about origin and evolution 

of life have been proposed till today of which 

theory of 'Gradual development of living 
organisms is accepted.
A peek into History
Many philosophers and religiousscholars 
have written their views about formation of 

life. There seems to be a thorough discussion 

over the formation of Universe, in various 

cultureslikeIndian, Chinese, Roman, 

Greek, etc. Various cultures have noted 

different type of information about planets, 

stars, the ‚panchmahabhuta™, living 

organisms, etc. in the form of poetry, stories 

and religious / sacred books.
Evolution  
 
Evolution is the gradual change occurring in living organisms over a long duration.  This is 
a very slow-going process through which development of organisms is achieved. All the stages 

in changes occurred in various components ranging from stars and planets in space to the 
biosphere present on the Earth should be included in the study of evolution. Formation of new 
species due to changes in specific characters of several generations of living organisms as a 
response to natural selection, is called as evolution.
Internet is my friend
 
Collect 
the information from internet 
about Big-Bang theory relatedwith the 

formation of stars and planets and present it 

in your class.
Can you recall?
Theory of Evolution:

According to this theory, first living material 

(protoplasm) has been formed in ocean. In 

due course of time, unicellular organism was 

formed. Gradually, changes occurred in the 

unicellular organisms from which larger and 

more complex organisms were formed. All 

those changes were slow and gradual. Duration 

of all these changes is at most 300 crore years. 

Changes and development in living organisms 

had been all round and multi-dimensional 

and this led to evolution of different types 

of organisms. Hence, this overall process is 

called as evolution which is organizational. 

Progressive development of plants and animals 

from the ancestors having different structural 

and functional organization is called evolution.

3. Vestigial Organs 
 
Degenerated 
or underdeveloped useless organs of organisms are calledas vestigial 
organs. In living organisms, sudden development of new tissues or organs for living in 

changing environment is not possible. Instead, existing organs undergo gradual changes. 

Mostly, a specific structure in the body is useful under certain situation. However, same 

structure under different situation may become useless or even harmful. Such structure begins 

to degenerate under such situation as per the principle of natural selection. It takes thousands 

of years for a structure to disappear. Such organs are seen in different phases of disappearance 

in different animals. Such organ, though non-functional in certain organisms, it may be 

functional in other organisms i.e. it is not vestigial in other organisms.

4. Palaeontological Evidences
 
A
 question may arise in your mind that which organisms existed millions of years 
ago? How can we tell this? Now this secret has been hidden in the Earth. Large number of 

organisms get buried due to disasters like flood, earthquake, volcano, etc. Remnants and 

impressions of such organisms remain preserved underground. These are called as fossils. 

Study of fossils is an important aspect of study of evolution.

with Nobel Prize (1960) 
for this invention. The age 
of the materials determined 
by this method are 
published in the journal 

‚Radio Carbon™
Introduction to Scientists
 
Carbon consumption
 of animals and plants stops after death and since then, only the 
decaying process of C-14 occurs continuously. In case of dead bodies of plants and animals, 

instead of remaining constant, the ratio between C-14 and C-12 changes continuously as 

C-12 is non-radioactive.  The timepassed since the death of a plant or animal can be 

calculatedby measuring the radioactivityof C-14 and ratio of C-14 to C-12 present in 

their body. This is ‚carbon dating™ method. It is used in palaeontology and anthropology 

for determining the age of human fossils and manuscripts. Once the age of fossil been 

determined by such technique, it becomes easy to deduce the information about other 

erstwhile organisms. It seems that vertebrates have been slowly originated from 

invertebrates.

Some 
plants and animals show some morphological characters by which they can be 
related to two different groups; hence they are called as ‚connecting links™.  Ex. In 
Peripatus
, 
characters like segmented body, thin cuticle, and parapodia-like organs are present. 

Similarly, these animals show tracheal respiration and open circulatory system similarto 

arthropods. This indicates that 
Peripatus
 is connecting link betweenannelidaand arthropoda. 
Similarly, duck billed platypus lays eggs like reptiles but shows relationship with mammals 

too due to presence of mammary glands and hairs. Lung fish performs respiration with 

lungs irrespective of being fish. These examples indicate that mammals are evolved from 
reptiles and amphibians from fishes. 
Observe and discuss.
 
Charles Darwin had collected 
innumerablespecimens of plants and animals and 
depending upon the observations of those specimens; he published the theory of natural 
selection which preaches the survival of fittest. For this purpose, Darwin had published a 

book titled 
‚Originof Species™
. While explaining the concept, Darwin says that all the 
organisms reproduce prolifically. All the organisms compete with each other in a life
-
-threatening manner. In this competition, only those organisms sustain which show the 

modifications essential for winning the competition. However, besides this, natural selection 

also plays important role because nature selects only those organisms which are fit to live 

and the rest perish. Sustaining and selected organisms can perform reproduction and thereby 

give rise to the new species with their own specific characters. Darwin™s theory of natural 

selection was widely accepted for long duration. However, some objections were raised 

against the theory. Some of the main objections are- 
1.
 
Natural selection is not the only factor responsible for evolution.
2.
 
Darwin did not mention any explanation about useful and useless modifications.
3. 
 
There is no explanation about slow changes and abrupt changes. 
 
Irrespective of all these objections, Darwin™s work on evolution has been a milestone.

Introduction to Scientists
Charles Robert Darwin (1809-1882)
 
This English biologist proposed the theory of evolution. 
He showed that all the species of living organisms have been 
gradually evolved over the period of thousands of years from 

common ancestor. He proposed that principle of natural selection 

is responsible for this evolution. 
Lamarck proposed that the 
activities of the organisms 

are responsible for their 

evolution. This French 

naturalist proposed that 

each animal or plant 

undergo some changes in 

its life span and those 

changes are transferred to 

the next generation and 

such changes occur in next 

subsequent generations too.
Jean-Baptiste Lamarck (1744-1829) 
Internet is my friend 
 
Collect the pictures and 
information of various 

species of monkeys from 

internet.
Lamarckism 
 
Jean-Baptiste Lamarck proposed that morphological changes occurring in living 
organisms are responsible for evolution and the reason behind those morphological changes 

is activities or laziness of that organism. He called this concept as principle of ‚use or disuse 

of organs™. 
 
The livin
g organism can transfer the characters which it 
has acquired, to the next generation. This is called ancestry of 

acquired characters.
1.11 Giraffe
 
Further, he said that the neck of giraffe has become 
too long due to browsing on leaves of tall plants by 

extending their neck for several generations; similarly, 

shoulders of the ironsmith have become very strong due 
to frequent hammering movements. Wings of birds like 
ostrich and emu have become weak due to no use. Legs 

of the birds like swan and duck have become useful for 
swimming due to living in water and snakes have lost their 
legs by modifications in their body for burrowing habit. 
All these examples are types of ‚acquired characters™ and 

are transferred from one to another generation. This is 

called as theory of inheritance of acquired characters or 

Lamarckism.
Introduction to Scientists
 
Development of organs due to specific activities or their 
degeneration due to no use at all was widely accepted but 

transfer of those characters from generation to generation 

was rejected. Because it had been verified many times 

that modifications brought in us are not transferred to next 
generation and thereby Lamarck™s theory was disproved.

Those apes started to live on land as the forests started to decline 
due to dry environment. 
Their pelvic girdle developed in such a way that they started to stand in erect posture in 
grasslands and thereby their hands became available for use, anytime. These first human
-
-like animals with erect posture which were using their hands have evolved about 2 crore 
years ago. 
 
First record of human-like 
animal is with us in the form of ‚Ramapithecus™ ape from 
North India and East Africa. Afterwards, this ape grown up in size and became more 

intelligent and thus the ape of South Africa evolved about 40 lakh years ago.
Speciation 
 
Formation of new species of plants and animals is the effect of evolution. 
Species is 
the group of organisms that can produce fertileindividuals through natural reproduction. 
Each species grows in specificgeographicalconditions. Their food, habitat, reproductive 

ability and period is different. However, genetic variation is responsible for formation of 

new species from earlier one. Besides, geographical and reproductive changes are also 

responsible. Similarly, geographical or reproductive isolation also leads to speciation

Human Evolution 
 
The biodiversity that is known today has been said to be formed from very simple 
unicellular organism due to evolution. In this evolution, origin of human evolution can be 
shown as per the picture given below. Last dinosaurs disappeared approximately seven 
crore years ago. At that time, monkey-like animals are said to be evolved from some 
ancestors who were more or less similar to the modern lemurs. Tail of these monkey-like 
animals of Africa is said to be disappeared about 4 crore years ago. They developed due to 
enlargement in brain their hands were also improved and thus ape-like animals were 
evolved. Meanwhile, these ape-like animals reached the South and North-East Asia and 
finally evolved into gibbon and orang-utan.
 
Remaining 
ape-like animals stayed in Africa and from them, gorilla and chimpanzee 
evolved about 2.5 crore years ago. Evolution of some of the 2 crore year old species of apes 
seems to be occurred in different way. They had to use their hands more for eating food and 
other work.

Living Organisms and Life Processes
 
Various organ-systems are continuously performing their functions in human body. 
Along with the various systems like digestive, respiratory, circulatory, excretory and control 
systems, different external and internal organs are performing their functions independently 

but through a complete co-ordination. This overall system is in action in more or less same 

way in all the organisms. Those are in need of continuous source of energy for this purpose. 

Carbohydrates, fats and lipids are the main sources of this energy and it is harvested by the 

mitochondria present in each cell. It is not like that only foodstuff is sufficient for energy 

production but oxygen is also necessary. All these i.e. food stuffs and oxygen are transported 

up to the cell via circulatory system. Besides, it is coordinated by the control system of the 

body. i.e. each life process contributes in its own way in the process of energy production. 

Functioning of all these life processes also requires the energy. 
 
Human and other animals consume the fruits and vegetables. Plants are autotrophs. 
They prepare their own food. They utilize some of the food for themselves whereas remaining 

is stored in various parts like fruits, leaves, stem, roots, etc. We consume all these various 

plant materials and obtain different nutrients like carbohydrates, fats, proteins, vitamins, 

minerals, etc. Which food materials do we consume to obtain these nutrients?
 
We obtain the carbohydrates from milk, fruits, jaggary, cane sugar, vegetables, 
potatoes, sweet potatoes, sweetmeats 
and cereals like wheat, maize, ragi, jowar, millet, 
rice, etc. We get 4Kcal energy per gram of carbohydrates. Let us study the way by which 
this energy is obtained.

two methods. Those two methods are aerobic respiration (oxygen is involved) and 
anaerobic respiration (oxygen is not involved). In aerobic respiration, glucose is oxidized 
in three steps. 
1. Glycolysis 
 
Process of 
glycolysis occurs in cytoplasm.A molecule of glucose is oxidized step by 
step in this process and two molecules of each i.e. pyruvic acid, ATP, NADH
2 
and water 
are formed. 
 
Molecul
es of pyruvic acid formed in this process are converted into molecules of 
Acetyl-Coenzyme-A. Two molecules of NADH
2
 and two molecules of  CO
2
 are released 
during this process.
2. Tricarboxylic acid cycle (Krebs cycle) 
 
Both molecules of acetyl-CoA
 enter the mitochondria. Cyclic chain of reactions called 
as tricarboxylic acid cycle is operated on it in the mitochondria.Acetyl part of acetyl-CoA 

is completely oxidized through this cyclicalprocess and molecules CO

ATP: Adenosine triphosphate is 
energy-rich molecule and energy is 

stored in the bonds by which phosphate 

groups are attached to each other. 

These moleculesare stored in the cells 

as per need. Chemically, ATP is 

triphosphate molecule formed from 

adenosine ribonucleoside. It contains 

a nitrogenous compound-adenine, 

pentose sugar- ribose and three 

phosphate groups. As per the need, 

energy is derived by breaking the 

phosphate bond of ATP; hence ATP is 

called as ‚energy currency™ of the cell.

processes participate in electron 

transfer chain reaction. Due to 

this, 3 moleculesof ATP are 

obtained from each NADH

molecule and 2 moleculesof ATP 

from each FADH
2
 molecule. 
Besides ATP, water molecules 

are also formed in this reaction. 
Electron transfer chain reaction is 
operated in mitochondria only.

If there 
is insufficient amount of carbohydrates in body due to exceptional

through complete oxidation of acetyl-CoA by the process of Krebs cycle in mitochondria.

Introduction To   Scientists
 
Process of glycolysis was discovered by three scientists 
Gustav Embden, 
Otto Meyerhof, and Jacob Parnas along with 
their colleagues. For this purpose, they performed experiments on 
muscles. Hence, glycolysis is also called as Embden-Meyerhof- 

Parnas pathway (EMP pathway).
 
The cyclical reactions of tricarboxylic 
acid cycle were 
discoveredby Sir Hans Krebs. Hence, this cyclical process is also 

called as Krebs cycle. He has been awarded the Nobel Prize in 

1953 for this discovery.

Energy Production in Microorganisms through Anaerobic Respiration
 
Some 
organisms cannot live in presence of oxygen. Ex. Many bacteria.Such living 
organisms have to perform anaerobic respiration for energy production. Glycolysis and 
fermentation are two steps of anaerobic respiration. Glucose is incompletely oxidized and 

less amount of energy is obtained in this type of respiration.  Pyruvic acid produced through 

glycolysis is convertedinto other organic acids or alcoholwith the help of some enzymes 

in this process. This is called as fermentation. Some higher plants, animals and aerobic 

microorganisms also perform anaerobic respiration instead of aerobic respiration if there 

is depletion in oxygen level in the surrounding.

Ex. Seeds perform anaerobic respiration if the soil is submerged under water during 

germination. Similarly, our muscle cells also perform anaerobic respiration while 

performingthe exercise. Due to this, less amount of energy is produced in our body and 

lactic acid accumulates due to which we feel tired.

Excess of the carbohydrates are stored in liver and muscles in the form of glycogen. 
What is the source of proteins? What are they made up of?
 
Proteins are the macromolecules 
formed by bonding together many amino acids. 
Proteins of animal origin are called as ‚first class™ proteins. We get 4 Kcal of energy per 
gram of proteins. Amino acids are obtained after digestion of proteins. Those amino acids 
are absorbed in the body and transported up to each organ and cell via blood. From these 
amino acids, organs and cells produce various proteins necessary for themselves and the 
whole body. Those examples are given in the following diagram.
 
Excess of amino acids 
obtained from proteins are not 
stored in the body. They are 

broken down and the ammonia 

formed is eliminated out of the 

body. If necessary, excess of 

proteins are converted into other 

useful substances like glucose 

through the process of 

gluconeogenesis.
 
Plants produce 
the necessary 
amino acids from minerals

and thereby produce different 

proteins. An enzyme RUBISCO 

present in the plant chloroplasts is 

most abundant protein found in 

nature.

Can you recall?
From where do we obtain the lipids?
       The substances formed by specific chemical bond between fatty acids and alcohol are 

calledas lipids. Digestion of lipids consumed by us is nothing but their conversion into 

fatty acids and alcohol. Fatty acids are absorbed up and distributed everywhere within 

the body. From those fatty acids, different cells produce various substances necessary to 

themselves. Ex. the molecules called as phospholipids which are essential for producing 

plasma membrane are formed from fatty acids. Besides, fatty acids are used for producing 

hormones like progesterone, estrogen, testosterone, aldosterone, etc. and the covering 

around the axons of nerve cells. We get 9 KCal of energy per gram of lipids. Excess of 

lipids are stored in adipose connective tissue in the body.

Cell division is one of the very important properties of cells and living organisms. Due 
to this property only, a new organism is formed from existing one, a multicellular organism 

grows up and emaciated body can be restored. 
 
There are two types of cell 
division as mitosis and meiosis. Mitosis occurs in somatic 
cells and stem cells of the body whereas meiosis occurs in germ cells. Before study of cell 

division, we should know the structural organization of cell that we have studied earlier. 

Each cell has a nucleus. Besides, other cell organelles are also present. Let us study the 

cell division with the help of this information. 
 
V
itamins are a group of heterogeneous compounds of which, each is essential for 
proper operation of various processes in the body. There are main six types of vitamins, 

e.g. A, B, C, D, E and K. Out of these, A, D, E and K are fat-soluble whereas B and C are 

water-soluble. We have seen that, FADH
2
 and NADH
2
 are produced in the processes like 
glycolysis and Krebs cycle. Vitamins like riboflavin (Vitamin B
2
) and nicotinamide 
(Vitamin B
3
) respectively are necessary for their production.

There 
is about 65 Œ 70% water in our body. 
Each cell contains 70% water weight by weight. 

Blood-plasma also contains 90% of water. 

Functioning of cells and thereby whole body 

disturbs even if there is a little loss of water from 

the body. Hence, water is an essential nutrient.

Along with all above mentioned nutrients, fibers 

are also essentialnutrients. In fact, we cannot 

digest the fibers. However, they help in the 

digestion of other substances and egestion of 

undigested substances. We obtain the fibers from 

leafy vegetables, fruits, cereals, etc.

2.5 Chromosome
 
A
  pair of each type of chromosome is present 
in 2n condition whereas single chromosome of each 
type is present in n condition and their structure is 

like the one shown in figure given beside.

Mitosis

Somatic cells and stem cells divide by mitosis. 

Mitosis is completed through two main steps. Those 

two steps are karyokinesis (nuclear division) and 

cytokinesis (cytoplasmic division). Karyokinesis is 

completed through four steps.

A. Prophase :
  In prophase, condensation of 

basically thin thread-likechromosomes starts. Due 

to this, they become short and thick and they start 

to appear along with their pairs of sister chromatids. 

Centrioles duplicate and each centriolemoves to 

opposite poles of the cells. Nuclear membrane and 

nucleolus start to disappear.

B. Metaphase :
 Nuclear membrane completely 

disappears in metaphase. Chromosomes complete 

their condensation and become clearly visible 

along with their sister chromatids. All chromosomes 

are arranged parallel to equatorial plane (central 

plane) of the cell. Special type of flexible protein 

fibers (spindle fibers) are formed between 

centromere of each chromosome and both centrioles.

C. Anaphase : 
 In anaphase, centromeres split and 
thereby sister chromatids of each chromosome 

separate and they are pulled apart in opposite 

directions with the help of spindle fibers. Separated 

sister chromatids are called as daughter 

chromosomes. Chromosomes being pulled appear 

like bunch of bananas. In this way, each set of 

chromosomes reach at two opposite poles of the 

cell.

Before 
any type of cell division, the cell doubles up its chromosome number present 
in its nucleus i.e. if chromosome number is 2n, it is doubled up to 4n. 
Can you recall?

D. Telophase :
 The chromosomes which have reached at opposite poles of the cell now 
start to decondense due to which they again become thread-like thin and invisible. Nuclear 
membrane is formed around each set of chromosomes reached at poles. Thus, two daughter  

nuclei are formed in a cell. Nucleolus also appears in each daughter nucleus. Spindle 

fibers completely disappear.             
 
In this way, karyokinesis completes 
and cytokinesis 
begins.
 
The cytoplasm divides by cytokinesis and two 
new cells are formed which are called as daughter 
cells. In this process, a notch is formed at the equatorial 
plane of the cell which deepens gradually and thereby 
two new cells are formed. However, in case of plant 
cells, instead of the notch, a cell plate is formed exactly 
along midline of the cell and thus cytokinesis is 
completed.
2.7 Cytokinesis 
 
Mitosis is essential 
for growth of the body. Besides, it is necessary for restoration of 
emaciated body, wound healing, formation of blood cells, etc.
2.8 Meiosis Part-I 
2.9 Meiosis Part -II
Meiosis:  
 
Meiosis is completed
 through two stages. Those two stages are meiosis-I and meiosis-
II. In meiosis-I, recombination / crossing over occur between homologous chromosomes 
and thereafter those homologous chromosomes (Not sister chromatids) are divided into 

two groups and thus two haploid cells are formed.

Meiosis-II is just like mitosis. 
In this stage, the two haploid daughter cells formed in 
meiosis-I undergo division by separation of recombined sister chromatidsand four haploid 

daughter cells are formed. Process of gamete production and spore formation occurs by 

meiosis. In this type of cell division, four haploid (n) daughter cells are formed from one 

diploid (2n) cell. During this cell division, crossing over occurs between the homologous 

chromosomes and thereby geneticrecombination occurs. Due to this, all the four daughter 

cells are genetically different from parent cell and from each other too.

What is the role of chromosomes in cell-division?
 
We 
have studied various life processes in previous classes. All those life processes i.e. 
nutrition, respiration, excretion, sensation & response (control & co-ordination), etc. are 
essential to each living organism to remain alive. Besides these life processes, one more life 
process occurs in living organisms; it is reproduction. However, reproduction does not help 

the organism to remain alive but it helps to maintain the continuity of the species of that 

organism.

4.
 
What is the relationship between the cell division and formation of new organism of 
same species by earlier existing organism?
 
Formation of new organism of same species by earlier existing organism is called as 
reproduction. Reproduction is one of the various important characters of living organisms. 

It is also one of the various reasons responsible for evolution of each species. In living 
organisms, reproduction occurs mainly by two methods. Those two methods are- 
asexual 
and sexual reproduction.

Can you recall?
Can you tell?
Process of formation of new organism by an organism of same species without 
involvement of gametes is called as asexual reproduction. As this reproduction does not 

involve union of two different gametes, the new organism has exact genetic similarity with 

the reproducing organism. This is uniparental reproduction and it occurs by mitotic cell 

division. Absence of genetic recombination is a drawback whereas fast process is advantage 

of this reproductive method.

23
A. Asexual reproduction in unicellular organisms 
1. Binary Fission
Activity 1 : 
Take a conicalflask and collect the 
water in it from a pond having stagnant water 
and aquatic plants. Add some wheat grains 

and aquatic plants to it. Keep it for 3 Œ 4 days 

so that wheat grains & plants will decompose. 

Early in the morning on fourth day, take a 

glass slide and put a drop of that water over 

it. Carefully, put a cover-slip on that drop and 

observe under compound microscope.
 
Y
ou will be able to see many paramecia 
performing the binary fission.
 
Prokaryotes (Bacter
ia), Protists (
Amoeba
, 
Paramecium
, 
Euglena
, etc.) and eukaryotic 
cell-organelle like mitochondriaand 

chloroplasts perform asexual reproductionby 

binary fission. In this process, the parent cell 

divides to form two similardaughter cells. 

Binary fission occurs either by mitosis or 

amitosis.
 
Axis of fission / division is different 
in 
different protists. Ex.: 
Amoeba
 divides in any 
plane due to lack of specific shape; hence it is 

called as ‚simple binary fission™. 
Paramecium 
divides by   ‚transverse binary fission™ whereas 

Euglena
 by ‚longitudinal binary fission™. 
 
Binary fission is usually performed 
by 
living organisms during favourable conditions 

i.e. availability of abundant food material.
2. Multiple Fission
 
Asexual reproductio
n by multiple fission is performed by Amoeba and other similar 
protists. Amoeba stops the formation of pseudopodia and thereby movementswhenever 

there is lack of food or any other type of adverse condition. It becomes rounded and forms 

protective covering around plasma membrane. Such encysted Amoeba or any other protist 

is called as ‚Cyst™.
 
Many nuclei 
are formed by repeatednuclear divisions in the cyst. It is followed by 
cytoplasmic division and thus, many amoebulae are formed. They remain encysted till 

there are adverse conditions. Cyst breaks open on arrival of favourable conditions and 

many amoebulae are released.

3. Budding:
Activity 2 : 
Bring the activedry yeast 
powder from market. Take 50 ml 

lukewarm water in a conical flask. Add 

5 gm of active dry yeast powder and 10 

gm table sugar to that water and mix 

well the mixture. Keep the flask in warm 

placeandafteranhourtakeadropof 

thatmixtureonacleanglassslide.Put 

a cover-glass on that drop and observe it 

under the compound microscope.
 
You will see the yeast cells performing budding i.e. a small bud coming  out of many 
parent cells. Asexual reproduction occurs by budding in yeast- a unicellular fungus.  Yeast 

cell produces two daughter nuclei by mitotic division, so as to reproduce by budding.  This 

yeast cell is called as parent cell. A small bulge appears on the surface of parent cell. This 

bulge is actually a bud. One of the two daughter nuclei enters this bud. After sufficient 

growth, bud separates from the parent cell and starts to live independently as a daughter 

yeast cell.
B.  Asexual reproduction in Multicellular organisms
1. Fragmentation:
 
Thistypeofasexualreproductionoccursinmulticellular 
organisms. In this type of reproduction, the body of parent 
organism breaks up into many fragments and each fragment 

starts to live as anindependentnew organism.This typeof 

reproductionoccurs in algae like 
Spirogyra
, and sponges like 

Sycon
.
 
Whenever there is plenty of water and nutrients are 
availableto 
Spirogyra
, its filamentsgrow up very fast and 

break up intomanysmallfragments.Eachfragmentstarts 

to live independentlyas a new

 fiber.If the body 

of 
Sycon
 breaks up accidentallyinto many fragments, each 
fragment develops into new

discards some part of its tail in emergency.Discarded part 

is regeneratedafter a period. This is an exampleof limited 

regeneration.However,undercertainsituations,ananimal-

3. Budding
 
In case of 
Hydra
, under favourable 
conditions, at specific part of its body, an 
outgrowth is formed by repeated divisions of 

regenerative cells of body wall. This outgrowth 

is called as bud. Bud grows up progressively 

and finally forms a small hydra. Dermal layers 

and digestive cavity of the budding hydra are 

in continuity with those of parent hydra. Parent 

hydra supplies nutritionto the budding hydra. 

Budding hydra separates from parent hydra and 

starts to lead an independent life when it grows 

up and becomesable to lead an independent life. 
4. Vegetative Propagation
 
Reproduction in plants with the help of 
vegetative parts like root, stem, leaf and bud is 

called as vegetative reproduction. Vegetative 

propagation in potatoes is performed with 

the help of ‚eyes™ present on tuber whereas in 

Bryophyllum
 it is performed with the help of buds 
present on leaf margin. In case of plants like 

sugarcane & grasses, vegetative propagation 

occurs with the help of buds present on nodes. 
5. Spore Formation
 
Take 
a piece of wet bread or ‚bhakari™ and 
keep it in humid place. Fungus will grow on it 

within 2 Œ 3 days. Observe the fungus under 

compound microscope and draw its diagram.

 Fungi like 
Mucor
 have filamentousbody. They 
have sporangia. Once the spores are formed, 

sporangia burst and spores are released. Spores 

germinate in moist and warm place and new 

fungal colony is formed.

Sexual reproduction always occurs with the help of two germ cells. Female gamete and
 
male gamete are those two germ cells. Two main processes occur in the sexual reproduction.

Gametes are formed by the meiosis. In meiosis, chromosome 
number is reduced to half; hence haploid gametes are formed.

. Fertilization:
 
A diploid zygoteis formed in this process by union of haploid maleand 
female gametes. The zygote divides by mitosis and embryo is formed. The embryo develops 

to form new individual.
 
Two parents i.e. male parent and female 
parent are involved in this type of reproduction. 
Fusion of male gamete of male parent and female gamete of female parent occurs. Due to 

this, new individual always has the recombined genes of both the parents. Hence, the new 

individual shows similarities with the parents for some characters and has some characters 

different than both parents. Diversity in livingorganisms occurs due to genetic variation. 

Genetic variation helps the organisms to adjust with the changing environmentand thereby 

to maintain their existence. Due to this, plants and animals can save themselves from being 

extinct.
1. What would have been happened if the male and female gametes

     had been diploid?

2. What would have been happened if any of the cells in nature had 

     not been divided by meiosis?
A. Sexual reproduction in plants 
 
Flower is structural 
unit of sexual reproduction in plants. It consists of four floral whorls 
as calyx, corolla, androecium and gynaecium; arranged in sequence from outside to inside. 

Androecium and gynoecium are called ‚essential whorls™ because they perform the function 

of reproduction whereas calyx and corolla are called as ‚accessory whorls™ because they are 

responsible for protection of inner whorls. Members of calyx are called as ‚sepals™ and they 

are green coloured. Members of corolla are called as ‚petals™ and they are variously colored.
 
A
  flower is called as ‚bisexual™ if both whorls i.e. androecium and gynoecium are 
present in the same flower. Ex. 
Hibiscus
. A flower is called as ‚unisexual™ if any one of 
the abovementioned two whorls is present in the flower. If only androecium is present, it is 
‚male flower™ and if only gynoecium is present, flower is ‚female flower™. Ex. Papaya.

Many flowers have the stalk for support, called as ‚pedicel™ and such flowers are called 
as ‚pedicellate™ whereas flower without stalk is called as ‚sessile™.
 
Androecium is male
 whorl and its members are called as stamens. Gynaecium is 
female whorl and its members are called as carpels.
 
These may be separate or united. Ovary is present at the basal end of each carpel. A 
hollow ‚style™ comes up from the ovary. Stigma is present at the tip of style. Ovary contains 
one or many ovules. Embryo sac is formed in each ovule by meiosis. Each embryo sac 

consists of a haploid egg cell and two haploid polar nuclei.
 
Pollen grains from anther are transferred to t
he stigma. This is called as pollination.  
 
Pollinati
on occurs with the help of abiotic agents (wind, water) and biotic agents 
(insects and other animals). Stigma becomes sticky during pollination Pollens germinate 

when they fall upon such sticky stigma i.e. a long pollen tube and two male gametes are 

formed. The pollentube carries malegametes.Pollen tube reaches the embryo sac via 
style. Tip of the pollen tube bursts and two male gametes are released in embryo sac. 
One male gamete unites with the egg cell to form zygote. This is fertilization. Second 

male gamete unites with two polar nuclei and endosperm is formed. As two male nuclei 

participate in this process, it is called as double fertilization.

When pollination involves only one flower or two 
flowers borne on same plant, it is called as self-pollination 
whereas if it involves two flowers borne on two plants of 

same species, it is cross-pollination. While discovering the 

new high yielding and resistant varieties of plants, 

scientists bring about the pollination with the help of brush.

We 
have studied in the chapterof heredity and variationthat men have XY sex-
chromosomes and women have XX sex-chromosomes. Reproductivesystem with specific 

organs develops in the body of men and women due to these sex-chromosomes only. 

X-chromosome is present in men and women whereas Y-chromosome is present in men 

only. Now we shall study the structure and functions of human reproductive system.
Human male reproductive system 
 
Male reproductive 
system of 
humans consists of testes, various 

ducts and glands. Testes are present 

in the scrotum, outside the abdominal 

cavity. Testes contain numerous 

seminiferous tubules. Germinal 

epithelium present in the tubules 

divide by meiosis to produce sperms. 

Those sperms are sent forward through 

various tubules. Sequence of those 

tubules is as- rete testes, vas eferens, 

epididymis,vas deferens, ejaculatory 

duct and urinogenitalduct. As the 

sperms are pushed forwards from one 

duct to next, they become matureand 

able to fertilize the ovum.

Human female reproductive system
 
 
All organs of female reproductive 
system are in abdominal cavity. It 
includesa pair of ovaries, a pair of 
oviducts, single uterus and a vagina. 
Besides, a pair of Bartholin's gland is 

also present.

Generally, every month, an ovum 
is released in abdominal cavity 
alternately from each ovary. Free end 
of oviduct is funnel-like. An opening 
is present at the center of it. Oocyte 

enters the oviduct through that 
opening. Cilia are present on inner 
surface of oviduct. These cilia push 
the oocyte towards uterus.
Surprising Facts 
1.
 
Length 
of each epididymis is about 6 
meters.
2.
 
Length of a sperm is about 60 micrometers.
3.
 
Such a small sperm has to cross the distance 
of approximately 6.5 meter while passing 
out of male reproductive system.
4.
 
Sperm needs large amount of energy. For 
this purpose, fructose is present in the 

semen. 
Gamete Formation
 
Both gametes i.e. sperm and ovum are formed by meiosis. Sperms are produced in 
testes of men from beginning of maturation (puberty) till death. However, in case of women, 

at the time of birth, there are 2 Œ 4 million immature oocytes in the ovaries of female 

foetus. An oocyte matures and is released from ovary every month from the beginning of 

maturity up to the age of menopause (approximately 45 years of age).  
Menopause is the 
stoppage of functioning of female reproductive system. At the age of about 45 Œ 50 years, 

secretion of hormones controlling the functions of female reproductive system either stops 

or becomes irregular. This causes the menopause.

Human female reproductive system
Fertilization
 
Formation of zygote by union of sperm and ovum is called 
as fertilization. Fertilization 
is internal in humans. Semenis ejaculated in vagina during copulation. Sperms, in the 

numbers of few millions start their journey by the route of vagina Œ uterus Œ oviduct. One 

of those few million sperms fertilize the only ovum present in the oviduct.
 
From the age of puberty up the menopause (from 10 Œ 17 years of age up to 45 Œ 50 
years), an ovum is released every month from the ovary. i.e. out of 2 Œ 4 million oocytes, 

approximately only 400 oocytes are released up to the age of menopause. Remaining 

oocytes undergo degeneration.
 
Seminal
 vesicles secrete their 
secretion in ejaculatory ducts whereas 

prostate gland and Cowper ™s glands 

secrete their secretions in urinogenital 

duct. Semen is formed of sperms and 

secretionsof all these glands. Semen 

is ejaculated out through penis. All the 

organs of male reproductive system 

are paired except urinogenital duct, 

prostate gland, penis & scrotum.

1. The chromosome number in germ cells 
producing the gametes are diploid i.e. 2n. It 
includes 22 pairs of autosomes and 1 pair of 

sex-chromosomes i.e. (44 + XX or 44 + XY). 

These germ cells divide by meiosis. Due to this, 

gametes contain only haploid (n) number of 

chromosomes i.e. (22 + X or 22 + Y). Two types 

of sperms are produced as (22 + X) or (22 + Y) 

whereas oocytes are produced of only one type 

as (22 + X).
 
Oocytes 
releasedfrom ovaries during last 
few months nearing the age of menopause are 

40 Œ 50 years old. Theirability of division has 

been diminished till now. Due to this, they cannot 
complete meiotic division properly. If such oocytes 
are fertilized, the new-borns produced from them 
may be with some abnormalities like Down™s 

syndrome.

 2. Both, sperms and oocytes are produced by meiosis. In case of sperms, process of meiotic 

division is completed before the sperms leave male reproductive tract. However, in case 

of oocytes, process of meiotic division completes after ovulation;during fertilization in 

oviduct.
Development and Birth
 
The zygote formed after fertilization 
in the 
oviduct, undergoes repeated mitotic divisions and 
embryo is formed. Meanwhile, it is pushed towards 
uterus. Once it reaches the uterus, it is implanted and 
further development occurs after implantation. An 
organ called as placenta is formed for supply of food 
material during the growth in uterus. Embryonic 
development is completed approximately within 
nine months after the fertilization.

3.21 Menstrual cycle 
Always remember
Menstrual Cycle:
 
Female 
reproductive system undergoes some changes at puberty and those changes 
repeat at the interval of every 28 Œ 30 days. These repetitive changes are called as 
menstrualcycle. Menstrual cycle is a natural process, controlled by four hormones. Those 

four hormones are follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), estrogen 

and progesterone. One of the several folliclesin the ovary starts to develop along with 

the oocyte present in it, under the effect of follicle stimulatinghormone. This developing 

follicle secretes estrogen. Endometrium of the uterus starts to develop (during first cycle) or 

regenerate (during subsequent cycles) under the effectof estrogen. Meanwhile, developing 

follicle completesits development. It bursts under the effectof luteinizing hormone and 

oocyteis released.This is called as ovulation.Remaining tissue of the burst follicle forms 

the corpus luteum. Corpus luteum starts to secrete progesterone. Endometrial glands 

secretetheir secretionunder the effectof progesterone. Such endometrium is ready for 

implantation of embryo.
 
The man is totally responsible, whether the couple 
will have a boy or a girl child. During zygoteformation, 

man contributes eitherX or Y chromosome to the 

next generation, but woman contributes only X-sex 
chromosome to the next generation. At the time of 
fertilization, if X- chromosomes comes from male, the 
child will be a girl and if Y-chromosome comes then 

the child will be a boy. 
Thinking of this, is it right to 
consider the mother responsible for a girl child? We 
all must take efforts to stop female foeticide.
Corpus 
luteum

32
 
If oocyte is not fertilized within 24 hours, corpus luteum becomes inactive and 
transforms into corpus albicans. Due to this, secretion of estrogen and progesterone stops 
completely. Endometrium starts to degenerate in absence of these two hormones. Tissues 
of degenerating endometrium and unfertilized ovum are discarded out through vagina. 
This is accompanied with continuous bleeding. Bleeding continuesapproximately for five 
days. This is called as menstruation.
 
Unless the 
oocyte is fertilized and embryo is implanted, this process is repeated every 
month. If the embryo is implanted, repetition of this cycle is temporarily stopped till the 

parturition and thereafter period of breast feeding. Menstrual cycle is a natural process 
and the women experience severe pains during this period. Severe weakness is felt due to 
heavy bleeding. There is higher possibility of infections too during this overall period. Due 
to all such reasons, there is need of rest along with special personal hygiene.
Reproduction and Modern Technology
 
Many couples 
cannot have childrendue to various reasons. In case of women, 
irregularity in menstrual cycle, difficultiesin oocyte production, obstacles in the oviduct, 

difficulties in implantation in uterus and many other reasons are responsible for this. 
Absence of sperms in the semen, slow movement of sperms, anomalies in the sperms are 
the reasons in case of males. But now with the  help of advanced medical techniques like 
IVF, Surrogacy, Sperm bank the childless couples can have a child.
In Vitro Fertilization (IVF)
 
 In this technique, fertilization is brought 
about in the test-tube and the embryo formed is 
implanted in uterus of woman at appropriate time. 

IVF technique is used for having the child in case 
of those childless couples who have problems like 
less sperm count, obstacles in oviduct, etc.
Surrogacy
 
Some women have problems in implantation 
of embryo in uterus. Such women can take the 
help of the modern remedial technique called as 
surrogacy. In this technique, oocyte is collected 

from the ovary of the woman having problem in 

implantation in uterus. That oocyte is fertilized 
in test-tube with the help of sperms collected 
from her husband. The embryo formed from such 
fertilization is implanted in the uterus of some other 

woman having normal uterus. Such a woman, in 

whose uterus the embryo is implanted, is called as 

surrogate mother.
Sperm Bank/ Semen Bank
 
There are various problems in sperm production as mentioned above, in case of many 
men. So as to have the children in case of such couples, new concept of sperm bank has 

been introduced. This concept is similar to blood bank. Semen ejaculated by the desired 

men is collected after their thorough physical and medical check-up and stored in the sperm 
bank.

Twins
 
Two embryos develop simultaneously in 
the same uterus and thus two offsprings are 
delivered simultaneously. Such offsprings 

are called as twins. Many couples have 
twins. 
 
There are two main types of twins 
as- monozygotic twins and dizygotic twins.
 
Monozygotic twins are formed from 
single embryo. During early period of 
embryonic development (within 8 days of 
zygote formation), cells of that embryo 
divide into two groups. 
 
Those two groups develop as two separate embryos and thus monozygotic twins are 
formed. Such twins are genetically exactly similar to each other. Due to this, such twins 
are exactly similar in their appearance and their gender is also same i.e. both will be either 
boys or girls.
 
In case of monozygotic twins, if the embryonic cells are divided into two groups 8 
days after the zygote formation; there is high possibility of formation of conjoined twins 

(Siamese twins). Such twins are born with some parts of body joined to each other. Some 
organs are common in such twins.

Y
ou may have read that sometimes a woman 
may deliver more than two offsprings at a time. Collect 
more information from internetabout reasons for such 

incidences.
Reproductive health 
 
A
  person™s state of being physical, mental and social strongness is called as health. 
In our country, there seems to be lack of awareness regarding reproductive health due to 

various reasons like social customs, traditions, illiteracy, shyness, etc. Especially, there 

seems to be indifference towards the reproductive health of women.
 
Occurrence of menstrual cycle is related with reproductive and overall health of women. 
Now a day, women are working at par with men. Due to this, they have to stay outdoors for 

whole day. Bleeding occurs during menstrual cycle. Due to this, private organs (genitals) 

need to be maintained clean time to time, otherwise, problems regarding reproductive 

health may arise. Some problems regarding reproductive health may arise in men too. It is 

essential to maintain the cleanliness of their genitals.
 
As per the wish of needful couple, oocyte of woman of the concerned couple is fertilized 
by IVF technique using the semen from sperm bank. Resultant embryo is implanted in the 

uterus of same woman. Name of the semen donor is strictly kept secret as per the law.
 
Occasionally, two oocytes are released from the ovary of woman and both oocytes 
are fertilized by two separate sperms and thus two zygotes are formed. Two embryos are 
formed from those two zygotes and both of those embryos are separately implanted in the 
uterus and thus dizygotic twins are delivered after complete development. Such twins are 
genetically different and may be same of different by gender.

Excessive 
growth of population within short duration 
is called as populationexplosion. You may have realized 
from the table given besides about fast population growth of 
India. We have to face various problems like unemployment, 
decreasing per capita income and increasing loan, stress on 
natural resources, etc. There is only one solution for all such 
problems and it is population control. Family planning is 
essential for this.

Ecosystem A review
 
Ecosystem 
is formed by biotic and abiotic 
factors and their interactions with each other. 
Each factor plays very important role in the 

ecosystem. Producers like plants are important. 

Herbivores like deer, goats, sheep, cattle, 

horses, camels, etc. feeding upon producers are 

also important. Predators like lion and tiger 

which prevent the overpopulation of herbivores 

are also equally important. A question may 

arise in our mind that whether the caterpillars 

found in nature, organisms present in filthy 

places, termites,insects present in dung, are 

reallyuseful? However, those organisms are 

also important though they are dirty. They are 

responsible for cleaning the environment. 
 
It 
means that our existence is due to these 
factors present around us. Hence, we should 

care for these factors.

Relationship between Environment and Ecosystem
 
Environment 
is a broad concept.Physical, chemical and biological factors affecting 
the living organisms in any possible way is collectively called as environment. In short, 

environment is the condition in surrounding. It includes many biotic, abiotic, natural and 

artificial factors. Thereare two main types of environment. One is natural environment 

and other is artificial environment.

Natural environment 
consists of air, atmosphere, water, land, living organisms, etc. 
Continuous interactions occur between biotic and abiotic factors. Their interactions are 

very important. Artificial environment is also affecting the natural environment directly 

or indirectly. Basically,environment consists of two basic factors- 1. Biotic factors, 
 
2. Abiotic factors. The science that deals with the study of interactions between biotic and 

abiotic factors of the environment is called as ecology. Basic functional unit used to study 

the ecology is called as ecosystem. 
 
Environment 
consists of many ecosystems. We have studied some ecosystems in 
earlier classes. A small pond is an ecosystem whereas the Earth is largest ecosystem. In 

brief, biotic and abiotic factors occupying a definite geographical area and their interactions 

collectively constitute the ecosystem.
Which cycles are operated in environment? What is their 
importance?
 
Environmental balance is maintained 
through continuous operation of various natural 
cycles like water cycle, carbon cycle, gaseous cycles like nitrogen cycle, oxygen cycle, etc. 
Environmental balance is also maintained due to various food chains of ecosystem. 
Human existenceis totally impossible without the existence of nature. Hence, it is 
basic responsibility of human being to preserve the nature without disturbing its balance. 

It is said that we have got this Earth planet on lease from our future generations and not 

as an ancestral property from our ancestors. Hence we should not forget to conserve it 

for ourselves and for future generations

Can you recall?
 
At present, many environmental 
problems have been arisen due to effect of various 
natural and artificial factors on the Earth. Environmental pollution is one of those main 

factors. Generally, contamination of any material is its pollution. Unnecessary and 

unacceptable change in the surrounding environment due to natural events or human 

activities are called as environmental pollution. i.e. direct or indirect changes in physical, 

chemical and biological properties of air, water and soil which will be harmful to humans 

and other living beings is environmental pollution. Various reasons like population 

explosion, fast industrialization, and indiscriminateuse of natural resources, deforestation, 

and unplanned urbanization are responsible for environmental pollution.
1. Which are the types of pollution?

2. What do we mean by natural and artificial pollution?
 
Pollution
 is a broad concept. 
Various types of pollutions like 

that of air, water, sound, soil, 

thermal, light, pollution occur 

around us. Ultimate adverse 

effect of all these is on existence 

of all the living organisms and 

out of this, environmental 

conservation has become the need 

of hour.
We have studied the air pollution, water pollution and soil 

pollution in detail in earlier classes. Based on that, complete 

the following chart.

Do you know?
Radioactive pollution: 
Radioactivepollution can occur due to two reasons as natural and 
artificial. UV and IR radiations are natural radiations whereas X-rays and radiations from 
atomic energy plants are artificial radiations. Chernobyl, Windscale, and Three Miles Island 

mishaps are the major mishaps of the world till present. Thousands of people have been 

affected for long term due to these accidents. Some of the effects of radiations are as follows-

1. Cancerous ulceration occurs due to higher radiations of X-rays.

2. Tissues in the body are destroyed.

3. Genetic changes occur.

4. Vision is adversely affected.
Why is it said that pollution control is important?
Need of environmental conservation
A peek into the history 
In 1972, United Nations 

Environment Program (UNEP) 

has been established in a 

conference arranged on human 

and environment in which 

environmental problems were 

discussed. Afterwards,  in India, 

a separate environmental 

department had been established 

after through discussion on 

environmental problems. 

Ministry of environment and 

forests is involved in planning, 

inducting and increasing 

awareness about environment 

and forest through various 

programs since 1985.   
 
General public is not aware about the rules of 
environment conservation. There should be large 

scale participation of the people in environment 

conservation. It will be possible to answer the 

environmental problems only if environmental 

protection-conservation becomes an effective 

public movement. For this purpose, values like 

positive attitude and affection towards environment, 

knowledge about it, etc. should be inculcated among 

the children since their childhood. This will help 

to make the future generations more aware about 

environmental conservation and protection. So as to 

achieve this, it is necessary to increase the awareness 

through education.
 
Today, 
all the developed, developingand 
underdevelopedcountries have accepted the 

responsibility of environmental protection. Their 

efforts are in that direction.They have defined the 

future plans about environmental protection and have 

constituted the necessary laws.

Environmental Conservation. Our social responsibility
 
Since existence of human, there is interrelationship between human and environment. 
Human stepped on the Earth long after formation of Earth. On the Earth, human being 
proved its superiority as compared to other animals with the help of characters like 
intelligence,memory, imaginary ability, etc.Human establisheddomination over the 
nature. Human utilizedall the natural resources as much as possible. In an attempt to live 
a satisfactory life, human kept on snatching from the nature as much as possible and this 
led to increase in problems. From this entire scenario, we can understand that human has 
crucial role in maintaining the environmental balance. If human has disturbed the 
environmental balance, then human itself only can conserve and improve the quality of 
nature. Many times, general public is unknown that its activities are harmful to environment 
and thereby unknowingly many activities happen.

Laws enacted about environmental 
conservation:
Forest Conservation Act, 1980.
 
The land reserved for forest 
conservation has been prohibited to 
use for any other purpose by this law. 
Ex. Permission of central government 

is compulsory for mining activities. 
Any person who disobeys this law is 
entitled to imprisonment for 15 days.
Environmental Conservation Act, 
1986.
 
Purpose of 
this act is to control 
the pollution and punish the persons 
or institutes harming the environment. 
Any person or factory is prohibited by 

this act from releasing the pollutants in 
atmosphere beyond a permissible limit. 
The person breaching this rule is entitled 
for either five year imprisonment or 
fine up to Rs. 1 lakh. National Green 

Tribunal has been established in 
2010 for effective implementation of 
environment related laws.

The big story of a small man
  
 
Jadav Molai 
Payeng is a highly capableperson in Assam. 
Born in 1963, he is working as a forest worker since the age of 
16 years. Once, large number of snakes died in the flood of 

Brahmaputra River flowing by the village. As a preventive 

measure, Molai planted 20 bamboo plantlets. In 1979, the 

local Social Forestry Department began a social afforestation 

project on 200 hectares of land. ‚Molai™ was one of the few 

forest workers who were looking after that project. Molai 

continued to plant the trees even after completion of the project. 

As a result of his continuous work of planting and caring for 

the trees, the barren area witnessed the forest cover over the 

1360 acres.
Today, this jungle in Kokilamukh of Jorhat district of Assam is the result of the hard work 

for 30 years. He has been awarded with the prestigious ‚Padmashree™ award by government 

of India for this unparallel work. Now, it is well known as ‚Molai Jungle™. Many people 
cometogether to destroy the forest, 
but a single person, if determined, can 
establish a 
new forest! 
Environmental Conservation and Biodiversity
 
Most 
harmful effect of the environmental pollution occurs on the living organisms. 
Have you seen some examples of this in your area? Our living world had been richly 
diverse. It consisted of varieties of plants and animals. However, we are not able to see 

some specific animals about which we had listened from our earlier generations. Who is 

responsible for this?
 
Biodiversity is the richness of living organisms in nature due to presence of varieties 
of organisms, ecosystems and genetic variations within a species. Biodiversity occurs at 

three different levels.

Genetic Diversity
 
Occurrence of diversity among the organisms of same species is genetic diversity. Ex. 
Each human being is different from other. Possibility of wiping out the species arises if 

there is decrease in the diversity within the species whose members involve in sexual 

reproduction.

Species Diversity
 
Innumerable species of organisms occur in the nature. This is called as species diversity. 
Species diversity includes various types of plants, animals and microbes.

Ecosystem Diversity
 
Many ecosystems are present in each region. Ecosystem is formed through the 
interaction between plants, animals, their habitat and changes in the environment. Each 

ecosystem has its own characteristic animals, plants, microbes and abiotic factors. 

Ecosystems are also of two types are natural and artificial.
 
There should be positive attitude of human being towards the environment for 
welfare of entire living world. For this purpose, following roles are important. You can 

be a conservator, organizer, guide, plant-friend, etc. Describe about the role you wish to 

perform and your plans for that role.

43
 
How can biodiversity be conserved?
1. Protecting the rare species of organisms.
2. Establishing national parks and sanctuaries.

3. Declaring some regions as ‚bioreserves™.

4. Projects for conservation of special species.

5. Conserving all plants and animals.

6. Observing the rules.

7. Maintaining record of traditional knowledge.
Sacred Groves
The forest conserved in the name of god 
and considered to be sacred is called as 
sacred grove. These are in fact ‚sanctuaries™ 
conserved by the society and not by the 

government forest department. As it has 

been conserved in the name of god, it has 

special protection. These clusters of thick 

forests are present not only in Western Ghats 

of India but in the entire country.
  
 
More than 13000 sacred groves have been reported in India. Where are such sacred 
groves in Maharashtra? Make a list and visit with your teachers.

Endangered Species
 
Either 
number of these organisms is declined or their 
habitat is shrunk to such an extent that they can be extinct in 
near future if conservativemeasures are not implemented. 
Example, Lion tailed monkey, lesser florican.
2.
 
Rare Species
 
Number of these organisms is considerably 
declined. 
Organisms of these species being endemic may become 
extinct very fast. Example, Red panda, Musk deer.

Vulnerable Species
 
Number of these organisms is extremely
 less and 
continues to decline. Continuous decline in their number is 
worrisome reason. Example, Tiger, Lion.

Energy and use of energy
 
In modern civilization, energy has become a primary need along with food, cloth and 
shelter.We need energy in different forms for diverse types of works. The energy that 
we need may be in the form of mechanicalenergy, chemicalenergy, sound energy, light 
energy or heat energy. How do we get these different forms of energy?
Can you tell?
 
We know that energy can be converted from one form to another. Different sources of 
energy are used  to the different forms of energy necessary for us. In previous standards 
we have learnt about energy, sources of energy and various conceptsrelated to them. 

Here we will learn about various sources that are now used for the generation of electrical 

energy, the methods that are used for this, the scientific principles that are used there,the 
advantages and disadvantages of these methods and also what is meant by green energy
. 
Most of the electricpower plants are based on the principle of electromagnetic induction 
invented by Michael Faraday. According to this principle, whenever magnetic field around 
a conductor changes, a potential difference is generated across the conductor. 
The field around a conductor can be changed in two ways. If a conductor is stationary 
and magnet is rotating, the field around the conductor changes or if a magnet is stationary, 

but the conductor is moving then also the field around the conductor will change. Thus, in 

both these cases, a potential difference is created across the conductor. (Figure 5.1). The 

electrical power generating machine based on this principle is called electric generator.

Proper energy source to run turbine
Turbine 
Electrical energy 
Generator
 Such large generators are used in commercial power generation plants. Turbine is used 
to rotate the magnet in the generator. A turbine has blades .When a flow of liquid or gas is 

directed on the blades of the turbine, it rotates (see Figure 5.2). because of the kinetic energy 

of the flow.This turbine is connected to electric generator. Thus the magnet in electric gener
-
ator starts rotating and electric energy is produced (Fig.5.3)
This method of electric energy generation can 
be represented as below.
Thus, to generate electricity based on the 
principleof electromagnetic induction, we need a 

generator. To rotate the generator we need a turbine 

and to drive the turbine, we need an energy source. 

Based on which type of energy source is used to 

rotate the turbine, there are different types of power 

generating stations. The design of the turbineused 

in different types of power stations is also different.
Thermal energy based electric power station
In this the turbine is rotated using steam. Water is heated in a boiler. Using the ther
-
mal energy released due to burning of coal. Steam of very high temperature and pressure 

is generated. The energy in the steam drives the turbine. Thus, the generator connected 

to the turbine rotates and electrical energy is produced. The steam is converted back into 

water and the water is re-circulated to the boiler. This is shown in flow chart in fig 5.5

If 
you see a thermal power station, you will observe two types of towers there. What 
are they? If you observe the schematicof the thermal power station in Figure 5.7 , you will 
get answer to this question.
 
Compare 
the schematicof the thermal power station with the block diagram above 
and you will understand how the boiler, turbine, generator and the condenser are arranged 

in the power station. 
 
After 
combustion of fuel (here, coal) in the boiler, the emitted gases are released to the 
atmosphere through very high tower. Once the turbine is rotated using the steam at high 

temperature and high pressure, steam temperature and pressure decreases. This steam is 

converted back to water by taking out heat from it (i.e.by cooling it) . This is done in the 

condenser using water in the cooling tower. The water in cooling tower is circulated through 

the condenser. Heat energy in the steam is given to the water and the steam condenses 

back to water. The heat absorbed by the water is then released to atmosphere through 

vapour and heated air through cooling tower.  Although, thermal power generation is a 

major way of electricity generation today, it suffers from certain problems
  
 
Since thermal energy is used here to generate
 electrical energy, such power plants are 
called thermal power plants. In thermal power plants, the chemical energy in the coal is 
converted into electrical energy through several steps which are shown in figure 5.6.
Let's Think
1. Why the energy in the coal is called as 
  
     chemical energy?
2.  Why steam is used to rotate the turbine?

particles are also released into 

the environment.This may cause 

serious health problems related to 
the respiratory system.

energy also , steam turbine is used to rotate the 
generator. However, here, the energy released by fission of nuclei of atoms like Uranium or 
Plutonium is used to generate the steam of high temperature and high pressure. The energy 
in the steam rotates the turbine, which in turn drives the generator producing electricity. 
The flow chart of nuclear power plant is shown in fig 5.8 .
 
Thus, here nuclear energy is converted into thermal energy, thermal energy is 
converted into kinetic energy of steam, kinetic energy of steam is converted into kinetic 
energy of turbine and finally the kinetic energy of the turbine is converted into electrical 
energy .The step-by-step transformation of energy is shown in  figure 5.5.
 
How does nuclear fission take place?
Can you tell?
 
When neutron is bombarded on atom of Uranium - 235 , it absorbs the neutron and 
converts into its isotope Uranium - 236.  Uranium - 236 being extremelyunstable converts 
into atoms of Barium and Krypton through a process of fission releasing three neutrons 

and 200 MeV energy. The three neutrons generated in this process cause fission of three  

other Uranium - 235 atoms releasing more energy.

The neutrons released in this reaction 
release more energy through fission of more 
uranium nuclei. 
This process of fission of  Uranium -235 atoms continues and is called 
the chain reaction. In nuclear power plants, a controlled chain reaction results in release 
of thermal energy, which is used for electric energy generation. 
A nuclear power plant does not use fossil fuel likecoal. Therefore,problems likeair 
pollution do not arise. Also, if sufficient nuclear fuel is available, this can be a good source 
of electrical energy. However, there are few problems associated with nuclear power 

generation.

Problems:

1.   The products after fission of nuclear fuel are also radioactive and emit harmful radiations. 

The products are called as nuclear waste. How to dispose the nuclear waste safely is a big 

challenge before the scientists.

2.    An accident in nuclear power plant can be very fatal. This is because the accident may 

result in release of very harmful radiations.

Power generation plant based on energy of natural gas
 
In this 
plant, the turbine is run by a gas at very high temperature and pressure generated 
by combustion of natural gas. A flow chart showing various stages in the power generation 
plant based on natural gas  energy  is shown in figure 5.12.
There are three main sections in this type of plant. Pressurised air is introducedinto 
the combustion chamber using a compressor. In the combustion chamber the natural gas 
burns in presence of the air. The gas at very high temperature and pressure generated in 

this chamber runs the turbine. The turbine then drives the generator to produce electricity. 
Step-by-step transformation of energy in this plant is shown in fig 5.13.

Electric energy generation and environment
Electricity generation based on fossil fuels like coal, 
natural gas and nuclear fuels like uranium and plutonium are 
not environment friendly. It means, that if electrical energy 

is generated using these fuels, it can lead to environmental 

degradation. 

1. We have seen that burning of fossil fuels like coal, and 

natural gas leads to emission of certain gases and soot 

particles. This results in air pollution. Incomplete combustion 

of fuels leads to formation of carbon monoxide. It adversely 

affects our health. Increase in percentage of carbon dioxide 

in the air due to burning of fuels affects environment 

severely. The phenomena of global warming is an example 

of this. Nitrogen dioxide generated due to burning of fuels 

like coal, diesel, petrol, etc. leads to problems like acid-rain. 

Soot particles generated due to incomplete burning of fossil 

fuel cause air pollution. It can lead to problems related to 

respiratory system, like asthama.

2. It took millions of years for formation of fossil fuels like 

coal, crude oils and natural gases (LPG and CNG). Also, the 

reserves of these fuels are limited. They are going to deplete 

in future. It is said that with the current speed of their use, 

the coal reserves in the world would last for another about 

200 years or so and the natural gas reserves for about 200-

300 years.

3. We have also discussed above about the problems in use 

of nuclear energy like the disposal of nuclear waste and 

possibility of disaster due to accident in nuclear power plant.
Considering all these points, it can be said that the 
energy generation from fossil fuels and nuclear fuels are 
not environment friendly. 
5.15 Different stages in hydroelectric power plant
Towards environment 
friendly energy–..towards 
green energy
:
There are other ways of 
electricity production which 
avoids above problems. 

Electricity generation from 

water reservoir, wind, 

sunlight, biofuels etc. are the 

examples of such methods. 

The energy sources used 

in such options i.e. water-

reservoir, wind, sunlight, 

biofuel are never-ending i.e 

are perpetual. Moreover, use 

of these sources do not lead 

to environmental problems 

discussed above. Therefore, 

electricity generation 

through these sources can be 

called environment friendly. 

We can also call the energy 

generated by these processes 

as green energy. Looking at 

the problems in electricity 

generation using fuels 

like coal, natural gas and 

nuclear fuels, the world 

is now heading towards 

environment friendly energy 

i.e. green energy.
Hydroelectric Energy
Kinetic energy in flowing water or the potential energy in water reservoir is a conventional 
source of energy. In hydroelectric power plant, the potential energy in water stored in dam 

is converted into kinetic energy of water. Fast flowing water is brought from the dam to the 

turbine at the bottom of the dam. The kinetic energy of the flowing water drives the turbine. 

The turbine in turn drives the generator to generate electricity.

The block diagram showing different components of hydroelectric power plant is shown in 

figure 5.15

3.What will be the effect on electricity

The schematic of hydroelectric plant is shown in Figure 5.17.  Water from about middle of the 
total height of the dam is taken to the turbine, as shown by point B in the diagram. 
Advantages of hydroelectric power 

generation
1.
 
Since 
no fuel is burnt in hydroelectric 
power generation, there is no pollution 

resulting from combustion of fuels.
2.
 
If there 
is sufficient water storage in the 
dam, it is possible to generate electricity as 

and when necessary.
3.
 
Although water reservoir is used for power 
generation,it can be replenished during 
rainy season leading to 
uninterrupted 
power generation.
Problems associated with hydroelectric 
power plant
1.
 
The 
back-water due to storage of water 
in dam may submerge villages or towns 

in that area. This leads to the problems of 

rehabilitation of the displaced population. 

Moreover, this can also submergeforests 

as well as fertile land.
2. 
 
The obstruction of the flow of river water 
may have adverse effect on living world 

in the river.
Since no fuel is burnt in hydroelectric 
plant, no air pollution due to combustion of 

fuel results. However, considering the issues 

like forced migration of large community, 

submerging of forests and fertile land, 

adverse effect on living creatures in the river, 

it has always been a point of debate whether 

the hydroelectricity is environment friendly 
or not. What is your opinion about it?

The kinetic energy in wind has been used since long for lifting of water, for driving 
floor mill etc. The wind energy can also be used for electricity generation. The machine 
which converts the kinetic energy of wind to electrical energy is called wind-turbine. As 

the wind strikes the blades of the turbine, the blades rotate. The axel of the turbine is 

connected to electric generator through a gear-box. The function of the gear-box is to 

increase the rotations per unit time. Thus, the rotating blades drive the turbine and the 

turbine in turn drives the generator to generate electricity. Various stages in the wind-

energy generation system can be shown in figure 5.19 and schematics of a wind mill is 

shown in figure 5.20.

Electric Energy generation using solar energy
Using the energy in the Sunlight, electric energy can be generated in two ways:
1. In all the above methods of electricity generation we have studied, the electric generator 
is driven by using some source of energy and electricity is generated by making use of 
the principle of electromagnetic induction. However, electricalenergy can be generated 

directlyfrom solar radiation without using generator and without using the principleof 

electromagnetic induction. This happens in solar photovoltaic cells. Solar photovoltaic 
cells convert the solar energy directly into electrical energy.
2. In the second method, the energy in solar radiation is converted into thermal energy first. 

Then a turbine-generator system is driven using that thermal energy to generate electricity.

1.Solar photovoltaic cell
Solar photovoltaic cell converts the solar radiation energy directly into electrical 
energy. This is called solar photovoltaic effect. The electrical energy generated through 

this energy transformation process is DC in nature. These solar cells are made of a special 

type of material called semiconductor (e.g. silicon). A silicon solar cell of dimension 1 cm
2 
generates current of about 30 mA and potential differenceof about 0.5 V. Thus, a silicon 

solar cell of dimension 100 cm
2
 will generate about 3 A (30 mA/cm
2
 X 100 cm
2
=3000 
mA= 3 A) current and 0.5 V. Rememberthat the potential differenceavailable from a 

solar cell is independent of its area.

5.26  
Solar cell to solar array 
If two solar cells are connected in series as 
shown in figure 5.23, the potential difference 
obtained from this combination is addition of 

the potential differences of individual solar 

cells. However, the current generated from 

this combination is equal to the current from 

an individual cell. It means that when solar 

cells are connected in series, currents from 

the individual cellsare not added. Similarly 

as shown in figure 5.24, if two solar cells are 

connected in parallel, the current generated 

from this combination is the summation of 

the currents from an individual solar cells. 

However, the potential difference obtained 

from this combination is the same as the 

potential difference obtained from individual 

cell. Thus, if two solar cells are connected in 

parallel, the potential differences from the two 

cells are not added.
In this way, by connecting many solar cells 
in series and in parallel solar panels generating 

required current and potential difference are 

made. See Figure 5.25. For example, if 36 

solar cells, each of size 100 cm
2
 are connected 
in series in a solar panel, it will give potential 
difference of 18 V and current of 3 A. Many 
such panels are connectedtogether to generate 
electricity on larger scale. A good solar cell 
can have an efficiency of around 15%. It 
means that if a solar panel receives power of 
100 watt from solar radiation, the electrical 
power output from the panel will be 15 watt. 
Many solar panels are connected in series 
and in parallelto generate required current 
and potential difference. As shown in Figure 

5.26, solar cell is the basic unit in solar electric 

plant . Many solar cells come together to form 

a solar panel. Many solar panels connected in 

series form a solar strings, and, many solar 

strings connected in parallel form a solar 

array. As we can obtain as much electrical 

power as needed, they are used in applications 

which need marginal power (e.g. calculators 

that run on solar energy) to power station of 

MW capacity.

However, most of the equipment in domestic

whatever energy we need. As shown in 
Figure 5.28, the DC power generated 
from these panels is first converted into 
AC power. A transformer transforms the 
voltage and current levels of the generated 

power and then it is fed into the electricity

5.29 Different stages in solar thermal power plant 
The power available from the solar cells is DC. So, in applications which need DC 
power , e.g. electric lights based on Light Emitting Diodes, the energy can be directly used. 
However, since the energy from solar cell is availableonly in presence of sunlight, the 

energy has to be stored in batteries for use at later time.
In this way, electricity is generated 
without any fuel combustion and so with
-

out any air pollution. However, since the 

energy is generated using solar radiation, 

solar cells can generate electricity during 

day-time only.

whereas some are too big. Some animals are terrestrial where as some are aquatic. Some 
animals crawl on land, some swim in water whereas some fly in air. Some animals have 

scales on skin whereas some have feathers or hairs. In this way, thereis huge diversity 

among the animals too. According to recent studies, estimated number of animal species 

on earth is approximately 7 million. It is impossible to study each and every species. 

However, if groups and sub-groups of animals are formed depending upon the similarities 

& differences, it will make it very easy to study such vast variety of animals.

exact role in the nature.
7.
 
It 
helps to understand various 
adaptations shown by animals.
 
Time 
to time, different scientists have tried 
to classify the animals. Greek philosopher 

Aristotle was the first to perform the animal 

classification. Aristotle classified the animals 

accordingto the criteria likebody size, 

habits and habitats. Further, as per the new 

developments in sciences, references were 

changed and thereby the criteria of animal 

classification too. Classification proposed 

by Aristotle is known as ‚Artificial method™. 

Besides Aristotle, artificial method of 

classification was followed by Theophrastus, 

Pliny, John Ray, Linnaeus, etc. Later on, 

‚Natural system of classification™ was followed. 

Natural system of classification was based on 

various criteria like body organization, types of 

cells, chromosomes, bio-chemical properties, 

etc. By the time, system of classification based 

on evolution was also brought into practice. It 

was used by Dobzhansky and Meyer. Recently, 

Carl Woese has also proposed the animal 

classification
 
Traditio
nally, depending upon presence or absence of the notochord, the animal 
kingdom has been divided into two groups-
 Non-chordates and Chordates.
History of animal classification
 
Non-chordates 
are classified / dividedinto ten phyla. Those phyla are- Protozoa, 
Porifera, Coelentarata / Cnidaria, Platyhelminthes, Aschelminthes,Annelida, 
Arthropoda, Mollusca, Echinodermata and Hemichordata
Traditional method of animal classification
A. Non-Chordates : 
Characters of non-chordate animals are as follows
1.
 
Body is not supported by rod-like notochord.
2.
 
Pharyngeal gill-slits are absent.
3.

This system of animal classification 
was in practice till now. However, now a days, new 
system of classification is followed. We will study this new system of animal classification 
in brief.
 
At present, according
 to the five kingdom classification system of Robert Whittaker, all 
multicellular animals are included in Kingdom: Animalia. This system of classification is 

based upon some criteria like Body organization, Body symmetry, Body cavity, Germinal 

layers, Segmentation, etc.
 
All chordate animals 
are grouped together in a single phylum and the name of 
phylum is same i.e. Phylum- Chordata. This phylum has been divided into three 

subphyla as- Urochordata, Cephalochordata & Vertebrata. Sub-phylum Vertebrata has 

been further divided into six classes as- Class: Cyclostomata, Class: Pisces, Class: 

Amphibia, Class: Reptilia, Class: Aves and Class: Mammalia.

Criteria for new system of classification
A. Grades of organization     
   
 
Body of animals is made 
up of cells. In 
case of multicellular animals, many cells 
are performing different functions in their 

body.  
 
In case of multicellular 
animals, if tissues are not formed, 

their body organization 
is called 
as ‚Cellular grade organization™. 

Ex. Phylum-Porifera. 
 
In case 
of some animals, 
cells come together to form 

tissues with the help of which all 

the body functions are performed. 

Such animals show ‚Cell - tissue 

grade™ organization. Ex. Animals 

from phylum- Cnidaria.
 
Flat 
worms show ‚Tissue-
Organ grade™ organization. In 

this type of organization, tissues 

are organized to form some 

organs. However, complete 

organ systems are not formed.

In unicellular organisms all the 
functions of life are performed by same 
cell. Body organization of these unicellular 

organisms is called 'Protoplasmic grade' 

of organization
Do you know?

65
Besides the four types of body organizations 
mentioned above, Remaining all animals show 

‚Organ - system grade organization™ in which 

different 
organs are joined together to form organ 
system that performs specific functions. Ex. Crab, 
Frog, Human, etc.
B.  Body Symmetry
 
Take the pictures of human body and spongilla 
and try to take an imaginary section through 
specificplane of their bodies so as to get two equal 
halves.
 
What di
d you observe?

Dead layer
  
6.10 
Diploblastic and triploblastic
C.  Germ Layers: Diploblastic and triploblastic
 
In imagi
nary sense, if body of any animal is cut through imaginary axis of body, 
it may or may not produce two equal halves. Depending upon this property, there are 
different types of animal bodies.
Asymmetrical Body :
 In case of such body, there is no any such imaginary axis of the 
body through which we can get two equal halves. Ex. some sponges.
Radial symmetry : 
In this type of body, if imaginary cut passes through central axis but 
any plane of body, it gives two equal halves. Ex. Star fish. In case of this animal, there are 

five different planes passing through central axis of body through which we can get two 
equal halves.
Bilateral symmetry: 
In this type of body, there is only one such imaginary axis of body 
through which we can get two equal halves. Ex. Insects, fishes, frog, birds, human, etc.
 
 
In case of multicellular 
animals, germ layers 
are formed during initial period of their embryonic 

development and from those germ layers only, 

different tissues are formed in the body. In case of 

some animals, only two germ layers [Endoderm & 

ectoderm] are formed. Ex.: All Cnidarians. In most 

of all the remaining animals, three germ layers are 

formed i.e. mesoderm besides endoderm & ectoderm.
6.8 Organ- System  grade of organization 
Bilateral Symmetry 

66
D. Body cavity (Coelom)
 
Cavity between 
the body wall and internal 
organs is called as body cavity/coelom.In case 
of multicellular animals, during initial period 

of their embryonic development, body cavity 

is formed from either mesoderm. Such type of 
body cavity is present in animals of phylum 
Annelida and all phyla coming after Annelida. 
Such animals are called as eucoelomate 

(animals with true body cavity). Body cavity is 

absent in case of animals from phyla Porifera, 
Cnidaria and Platyhelminthes. Such animals 
are called as acoelomate. In case of animals 
from phylum Aschelminthes, they have body 

cavity but it is not formed by the above 

mentioned two ways. Hence those animals are 

called as pseudocoelomates.

E. Body Segmentation
 
If the body of animals 
is divided into 
small, similar units, then such body is called as 

segmented body and each small unit is called 

as segment. Ex. Animals like earthworm from 

phylum Annelida. 
With the help of above mentioned criteria, animals are classified .

Applied Microbiology
 
Branch of biology in which study of the enzymes 
related to some prokaryotes and 
eukaryotic microbes, proteins, applied genetics, molecular biology, etc. is performed; is 
called as applied microbiology. This study is used for the society and various products like 
food and medicines are produced on large scale with the help of microorganisms.
We use the fermentation process while conversion of milk into 
yoghurt. Which microbes are useful for this process?
Products

A. Dairy Products
 
Since ancient days, milk is converted into various products for its preservation purpose. 
Ex. Cheese, butter, cream, kefir, yoghurt, etc. Water content and acidity of the milk changes 
during formation of these products and texture, taste and flavour is improved.
 
These processes are performed on large scale with more skill. For production of most 
of the milk products, bacteriain milk itself are used; only cheese is produced with the help 

of fungi. Basic process for production of yoghurt, cheese and cream is same. Milk is 

pasteurized at the beginning to destroy unwanted microbes. It is then fermentedwith the 
help of lactobacilli. In this process, lactose sugar of the milk is converted into lactic acid 
and milk proteins are coagulated with the help of lactic acid. Besides, compounds with 

taste and flavour are also formed. Ex. Diacetyl has the flavour of butter.

2. Yoghurt Products 
 
Yoghurt is a milk product produced with the help of lactobacilli(inoculant). For 
maintaining the protein content, condensed milk powder is mixed with milk to be fermented 
for industrial production of yoghurt. Milk is boiled and once it cools to warm temperature, 

bacterialstrains of 
Streptococcus thermophilus
 and 
Lactobacillus delbrueckii
 are added to it 
in 1:1 proportion. Lacticacid is formed due to Streptococcus that makes the proteins to gel out 
that gives dense consistency to the yoghurt. 
 
Acetaldehyde like compounds are formed due to lactobacilli 
that gives characteristic taste to the yoghurt. Now a day, various 
fruit juices are mixed with yoghurt to impart different flavours. Ex. 

Strawberry yoghurt, banana yoghurt, etc. Shelf life of yoghurt and 

its probiotic properties can be improved by pasteurization.
3. Butter
 
Two types of butter like sweet cream and cultured are produced 
on large scale. Microbes are used for production of cultured variety. 
4. Cheese production
 
Cheese 
is produced on large scale from the abundantly available 

cow milk all over the world. First, chemical and microbiological 

tests of milk are performed. Some colours and microbes like 

Lactobacillus lactis, Lactobacillus cremoris,
 and 
Streptococcus 

thermophilus
 are mixed with milk. It imparts sourness to the milk. 

After this, to impart the dense texture, whey (water in yoghurt) needs 

to be removed. 
 
An enzyme, rennet obtained from alimentary canal of cattle 
was 
being traditionally used earlier. However, an enzyme protease 
obtained from fungi is used at present to produce vegetarian cheese. 
 
The whey is separated from yoghurt (which has some other 
uses). Then, process of production of cheese is started through steps 
Let™s think 
Do you know?
1.  Which different types of cheese are used in western food like 
 
     pizza, burger, sandwich, etc?

2. What is difference between those types of cheese?
 
During industrial production of milk products, strict cleanliness and sterilization 
is essential as bacteria can be attacked by viruses. Hence, virus-resistant varieties of 

bacteria are developed. Recently, use of mutant varieties of bacteria has been increased. 

Artificially, some strains are developed that will help to avoid unnecessary steps / 

materials. 
 
Freshly prepared cheese is always soft e.g. cottage cheese, cream cheese, mozzarella 
cheese. On storing for 3 to 12 months, semi-hard cheddar cheese is formed whereas after 

ripening for 12 Œ 18 months, very hard cheese called parmesan cheese is formed.

These are also milk 
products, but contain active bacteria e.g. 
Lactobacillus, 
Acidophilus,Lactobacilluscasei, Bifidobacterium bifidum,
 etc. These microbes maintain 
the balance of intestinal microorganisms i.e. increase the population of microbes helping 
the digestion and decrease the population of harmful microbes (ex. 
Clostridium
). Probiotic 
products are available in various forms likeyoghurt, kefir, sauerkraut (pickle of cabbage), 

dark chocolate, miso soup, pickles, oils, corn syrup, artificial sweeteners, microalgae(Sea 

food like 
Spirulina, Chlorella
, Blue green algae,  etc.).
 
What for probiotic food is famous?
 
Bread
 
Different types of breads are produced from flour of cereals. Dough is formed by 
mixing of baker™s yeast Œ
 Saccharomyces cerevisiae
, water, salt and other necessary 
materials with flour. Due to fermentation of carbohydrates by yeast, sugar is converted in 

to carbon dioxide (CO
2
) and ethanol. Dough rises up due to CO
2 
and the bread becomes 
spongy. 
 
Compressed yeast is used in commercial 
bakery industry. It is available in dry, 
granular form for domestic use. Yeast produced for commercial use contains various 

useful contents like carbohydrates, fats, proteins, various vitamins, and minerals. Due to 

this, bread and other products produced with the help of yeast become nutritive. Ingredients 

like vinegar, soya sauce and monosodium glutamate (ajinomoto) that are used in presently 

popular chinese food are produced by microbial fermentation.
 
Why 
the probiotics have developedmuch importancein 
recent days? These products form the colonies of useful 

microbes in alimentary canal and control other microbes and 

their metabolic activities, improve resistance and lower the 

ill-effectsof harmful substances formed during metabolic 

activities. Useful microbes becomeinactive due to antibiotics; 

probiotics make them active again. 
 
Nowadays, probiotics are used for treatment 
of diarrhoea 
and treatment of poultry also.

food materials and for preservation of pickles, sauce, ketch-up, chutneys, 

etc. Chemically, vinegar is 4% acetic acid (CH
3
COOH).

Production of beverages
1. Which functions are performed by enzymes secreted in 

     human  digestive system?

2. Give names of some such enzymes.
Microbial Enzymes
 
Nowadays, instead 
of chemical catalysts, microbial enzymes are used 
in chemical industry. These enzymes are active at low temperature, pH and 

pressure; due to which energy is saved and erosion-proof instruments are also 

not necessary. Enzymes carry out specific processes; hence unnecessary by-

products are not formed due to which expenses on purification are minimised.
In case of microbial enzymatic reactions, elimination and decomposition 
of waste materialis avoided and enzymes can be reused. Hence, such 

enzymes are eco-friendly. Some examples of microbial enzymes are oxido-

reductases, transferases, hydrolases, lyases, isomerases, ligases, etc.
Process of dirt / muck removal occurs at low temperature too due to mixing of 
enzymes with detergents. Glucose and fructose syrup can be obtained from corn flour 

by action of enzymes obtained from bacilliand streptomyces. Microbial enzymes 

are used in various industries like cheese, plant extracts, textile, leather, paper, etc.

3. Decomposition occurs through which organisms?
Microbes and Fuels
1. Gaseous fuel- methane can be obtained by microbial     
anaerobic decomposition of urban agricultural and industrial 

waste.
2. Ethanol, an alcohol is a clean (smokeless) fuel 
obtained during fermentation of molasses by the yeast- 
Saccharomyces. 
3. Hydrogen gas is considered to be the fuel of future.  
Hydrogen gas is released during bio-photolysis of water in 

which bacteria perform the photoreduction.
Similar to fuels, various industrial chemicals are also produced through microbial 
process. Ex. various alcohols, acetone,organic acids, fatty acids, polysaccharides, that  

are useful as raw materials in chemical industry. Some of these are useful as raw materials

Microbial Pollution Control 
 
Solids wastes, sewage and various pollutan
ts are ever increasing with increase in 
pollution. Along with it, ever increasing diseases and degradation of environmentare the 
world-wide problems. Especially, cities in densely populated countries like India are 

affected with these problems. Life of the future generations will be difficult if these 

problems are not solved at right time and to right extent. Let us see the role of microbes in 

environment.
 
Y
ou already know that microbes are used for disposal of solid waste through biogas 
plant and compost production. How urban waste that is accumulated in terms of tonnes, 

may be disposed off ?
1. Why is it asked to segregate wet and dry waste in each home?

2. What is done with the segregated waste?
3. Which is most appropriate method of disposal of dry waste?
Land-filling sites
Degradable waste being 
accumulated in urban areas 
is used for this purpose. Large 

pits are dug in open spaces far 

away from the residential area 

and those pits are lined with 

plasticsheets as a precaution 

against pollution of soil due to 

leaching of toxic and harmful 

materials. 
Compressed waste is dumped in the pit. It is covered with layers of soil, saw dust, 
leafy waste and specificbiochemicals. Bioreactors are mixed at some places. Microbes 

present in soil and other top layers decompose the waste. Completely filled pit is sealed 

with soil slurry. Best quality compost is formed after few days. Such land filling sites can 

be reused after removal of compost.  
Observe the garbage vans of grampanchayat and municipality. 
Nowadays, there is facility of decreasing the volume of garbage by 
compaction in those vans. Explain the advantages of this activity.
Sewage Management
In villages, domestic sewage is disposed off either in nearby soil or in biogas plant. 
However, in cities, sewage needs to be carried to processing unit and acted upon by 
microbial processes. 
Microbes which can decompose any compound as well as destroy the pathogens 
of cholera, typhoid, etc. are mixed with sewage. They release methane and CO
2
 by 
decomposition of the carbon compounds present in sewage. Phenol oxidizing bacteria 

decompose the xenobiotic chemicals present in sewage.

Clean Technology
Human being has made a very fast progress in technology. 
However, environmental 
pollutionis also increasing with same speed. Let us see the ways of control over air, soil 

and water pollution with the help of microbes. 
Microbes have natural ability of decomposing the manmade chemicals. Hydrocarbons 
and other chemicals are transformed with the help of these abilities.
1. Some microbes remove the sulphur from fuels.

2. Metals like copper, iron, uranium, zinc, etc. leach into environment from low 
quality metalloids. These are converted into compounds before leaching, with the help of 

thiobacilli and sulphobacilli.
You must have seen or read the news of dead fishes or 
oily water accumulating at the sea coasts. Why does this 

happen?
Spilling of petroleum oil occurs in ocean due to various 
reasons. This oil may prove fatal and toxic to aquatic 

organisms. It is not easy to remove the oil layer from surface 

of water by mechanical method. However, bacteria like 

Pseudomonas 
spp. and 
Alcanovorax borkumensis
 have 
the ability to destroy the pyridines and other chemicals. 

Hence, these bacteria are used to clear the oil spills. These 

are called as hydrocarbonoclastic bacteria (HCB). HCB 

decompose the hydrocarbons and bring about the reaction 

of carbon with oxygen. CO
2
 and water is formed in this 
process.
Plastic bottles are formed from the chemicalsubstance 
PET (Polyethylene Terephthalate Polyester). Now a day, 

most of the urban garbage consists of plastic. It has been 

observed that species like 
Vibrio,
 
Ideonella sakaiensis 
can decompose the PET. Similarly, species of bacteria 

like 
Actinomycetes, Streptomyces, Nocardia, Actinoplanes
 
have ability of decomposing rubber from garbage.

Sulphuric acid is present in the acid rain and materials 
coming out of mines. You know that erosion of metals present in 
statues, bridges and buildings occurs due to it. Sulphuric acid is 

source of energy for some species of bacteria like 
Acidophillium 

spp. and 
Acidobacillus ferroxidens
. Hence, these bacteria can 

control the soil pollution occurring due to acid rain.

Water soluble salts of uranium are present in the wastes 
produced during 
electroplating and in effluent released in environment from the atomic energy plant. 

Geobacter 
convert these salts of uranium into insoluble salts and thereby prevent those 
salts from mixing with ground water sources. 
Microbes and Farming
Can you tell?
Microbial Inoculants
Some microbes-containing inoculants are produced by process of fermentation.These 
inoculants are sprayed on seeds before sowing and some of the inoculants are released 

into plants. Microbes in the inoculants help in plant growth by supplying nutrients. They 

improve the quality of vegetarian food. Solution containing 
Azotobacter
 and artificial 
nitrogenase is used in organic farming. 
Soil pollution occurring due to 
chemicalfertilizersis prevented due to use 

of these solutions. Fluoroacetamide-like 

chemicals are mixed with soil due to use of 

chemical pesticidesin agriculture. These 

prove to be harmful to other plants and 

animals as well as cause skin diseases to 

human. These pesticidesin the soil can be 

destroyed with the help of microbes. 

Bioinsecticides 
Bacterial and fungal toxins which 
can destroy pests and pathogens can be 

directly integrated into plants with the help 

of biotechnology.Being toxic to insects, 

they do not consume the plants. Similar to 

bacteria, some species of fungi and viruses 

are useful as pesticides. Spinosad, a by-

product of fermentation is a biopesticide.

3. Which technique in relation to tissues have you studied in   

    earlier  classes?

4. Which are the various processes in tissue culture?
 
We 
have studied the plant productionby technique of tissue culture in the last class. 
Stem cells are used for that purpose. Whether such stem cells are present in animals?

89
Use your brain
Stem cells are present in the umbilical cord by which the foetus is joined to the uterus of 
the mother. Stem cells are also present in the blastocyst stage of embryonic development. 
Stem cells are present in red bone marrow and adipose connective tissue of adult human 

beings. It has become possible to produce different types of tissues and the degenerated part 

of any organ with the help of these stem cells.
Stem Cell Preservation
 
For the purpose of preservation, stem cell samples are carefully collected 
from sources 
like cord blood, red bone marrow or embryo (blastocyst) and are kept in small, sterile vials. 
Those vials are kept in liquid nitrogen at -135
0
C to -190
0
C.
Adult stem cells
Stem cells can be obtained from the body of adult person too. There are three main  
sources of stem cells in the body of adult persons. Stem cells can be obtained from red bone 
marrow, adipose connective tissue and blood. Besides, stem cells can be obtained from cord  
blood immediate after birth.  
Uses of Stem Cells
1. Regenerative Therapy
A.
 
Cell Therapy: Stem cells are used to replace the dead cells in case of conditions like
 
diabetes, myocardial infarction, Alzheimer™s disease, Parkinson™s disease, etc.   
B.
 
To produce blood cells required in conditions like anaemia, thalassemia, leukemia, etc.
 
2. Organ Transplantation:
 In case of failure of organs like kidney and liver, those can be 
produced with the help of stem cells and transplanted.  
 
During further development, these cells form any type of cell, different types of tissues 
and perform different functions in the body. This is the differentiation of stem cells. However, 
once the tissues are formed, the cells in those tissues, at the most, can form same types of cells 

only. This is the case in each part of the body. However, stem cells are present for longer 

duration in some parts of the body.
 
 
Just 
like the grafting in plants, is the organ transplantation              
possible in humans?
Stem cell research
In biotechnology, stem cell research is a revolutionary event after cloning. This technique 
has the potential of bringing about the fundamental changes in the medical science. 
Depending upon source, stem cells are of two types as embryonic stem cells and 
adult stem cells. 

Embryonic stem cells
Division of the zygote starts and thereby it is converted into embryo. Cells of embryo  
undergo repeated mitotic divisions. Cell differentiation starts from 14
th
 day of conception. Cells 
of different organs like osteocytes (bone cells), hepatocytes (liver cells), and neurons are formed  

due to differentiation. Embryonic cells before differentiation are called as embryonic stem cells.  

220 different types of cells in human body are formed from single type cells i.e. embryonic stem 

cells. Thus, stem cells are primary type of undifferentiated cells with self-multiplying ability  

and they are parent cells of all types of human cells. This property of stem cells is called as 

pleuripotency.  It has been found that if these stem cells are collected well before the beginning  

of differentiation on 14
th
 day i.e. during 5
th
 Œ 7
th
 day and cultured with certain biochemical 
stimulus in laboratory, as per the stimulus, they can transform themselves into desired type of  
cells, thereby tissues and  finally into organs.

90
Discuss about stem cells and organ transplantation in the class 
with the help of figures given below.
Observe
Organ transplantation
Various organs in the human body 
either
 become less efficient or completely 
functionless due to various reasons like 
aging, accidents, infections, disorders, etc. 

Life of such person becomes difficult or 

even fatality may occur under such 

conditions. However, if a person gets the 

necessary organ under such conditions, its 

life can be saved. 
Availability of donor is an important 
requirement in organ transplantation.Each 

person has a pair of kidneys. As the process 

of excretion can occur with the help of 

single kidney, person can donate another 

one. Similarly,   skin    from    certain parts 

of the body can also be donated.
Various factors like blood group, 
diseases, disorders, age, etc. of the donor 

and recipientneed to be paid attention 

during transplantation.
However, other organs cannot be 
donated during life time.Organs like liver, 

heart, eyes can be donated after death only. 

This has led to the emergenceof concepts 

like posthumous (after death) donation of 

body and organs.
Organ and Body Donation: 
Human bodies are disposed off after death as per traditional 
customs. However due to progress in science, it has been realized that many organs remain 
functional for certain period even after death occurs under specific conditions. Concepts like 

organ donation and body donation have emerged recently after realization that such organs can 

be used to save the life of other needful persons. A liberal view behind the concept of organ and 

body donation is that after death, our body should be useful to other needful persons so that their 

miserable life would become comfortable. Awareness about these concepts is increasing in our 

country and people are voluntarily donating their bodies.
Life of many people can be saved by organ and body donation. Blinds can regain the 
vision. Life of many people can be rendered comfortable by donation of organs like liver, 

kidneys, heart, heart valves, skin, etc. Similarly, body can be made availablefor research in 

medical studies. Many government and social organizations are working towards increasing the 

awareness about body donation.

Always Remember
Biotechnology
We have studied in the earlier class that biotechnology is bringing about artificial 
geneticchanges and hybridizationin organisms for human welfare. Various branches of 
science like cytology, biochemistry, molecularbiology, and geneticengineeringare 

included in biotechnology. Thereis considerable progress mainlyin the fieldof agriculture 

and pharmacy due to biotechnology. New experiments are being performed for improving 

the agricultural yield. In pharmacy, experiments for production of antibodies, vitamins, 

and hormones like insulin have been successful. High-class varieties of crops have been 

developed through the technique of tissue-culture.

Biotechnology includes following main areas

1.
 
Use of various abilities of microbes like yoghurt production from milk and alcohol
 
from molasses.
2.
 
Use of 
productivity of the cells.Ex. Œ Production of antibiotics and vaccines,etc.with 
 
the help of specific cells.
3.
 
Use of bio-molecules like DNA
 and proteins in human welfare.
4.
 
Development of plants, animals and products of desired quality by gene manipulation.
 
Production of human growth hormone with the help of genetically 
modified bacteria.
5.
 
Use of genetic 
and non-genetic technique. Non-genetic biotechnology involves use of 
 
either cell or tissue. Ex. Tissue culture, production of hybrid seeds, etc.
Benefits of Biotechnology

1.
 
It has become 
possible to increase the per hectare yield irrespective of the limitations 
 
of crop-land area.
2.
 
Expenses on disease control have minimized 
since development of resistant varieties.
3.
 
Due to development 
of fast fruit setting varieties, yield per annum has been increased
.
4.
 
Development of stress resistant varieties which can withstand variable temperature, 
 
water-stress, changing fertility of soil, etc. has become possible.

Development of Biotechnology in India
 
Government 
of India had established the National BiotechnologyBoard in 1982. 
This board was transformed into department of biotechnology under the ministry of 
science and technology, in 1986. Various institutes in India are working under the control 

of this department of biotechnology. It includes National Institute of Immunology, 

National Facility for Animal Tissue and CellCulture, National Centrefor CellScience, 

National Brain Research Centre, Central Institute of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants. 

There are facilities of higher education and research in these institutes from where 

thousands of students have pursued Ph.D. degrees and are contributing to the progress 
of country in the field of biotechnology.
Commercial Applications of Biotechnology: 
1.
 
Crop Biotechnology:
 Biotechnologyis used in 
agricultural field to improve yield and variety.
a.
 
Hybrid Seeds:
 Genes of two different crops are 
recombined to form hybrids of various crops. This is 

especially useful for fruits.

b.
 
Genetically 
Modified Crops:
 Crops developed 
with desired characters by integrating foreign gene 

with their genome are called as genetically modified 

crops. High yielding varieties with resistance to 

diseases, alkalinity,weeds, other stresses like cold 

and drought.  
Bt Cotton:
 A gene had been isolated from the 
bacterium 
Bacillus thuringiensis
 and integratedwith 
the genome of cotton. Due to this, the toxin which is 

fatal for bollworm was produced in leaves and bolls 

of cotton. If bollworm feeds on leaves, the toxin 

destroys its alimentary canal and the bollworm dies.
 
Bt Brinjal:
 BT Brinjal variety is developed by 
using the gene isolated from 
Bacillus thuringiensis
. 

This improved variety of brinjal kills the pest in same 

way as the Bt cotton does.
Golden Rice:
 A gene synthesizing the vitamin A 
(Beta carotene) has been introduced in this variety of 

rice. As compared to the normal variety, this variety 

which has been developed in 2005 contains 23 times 

more amount of beta carotene.
8.5  Some crops 
Herbicide tolerant plants:
 Weeds always affect 
the growth of main crop. If herbicides are used to 

destroy the weeds, it affects the main crop too. Due to 

this, Herbicide tolerant plants varieties of crops are 

being developed. Due to this, it has become possible 
to selectively destroy the weeds.

USE OF ICT
c.
 
Biofertilizers
Due to use of biofertilizers instead of chemical 
fertilizers, nitrogen fixation and phosphate 
solubilization abilities of the plants are improved. 
Mainly the bacteria like 
Rhizobium, Azotobacter, 
Nostoc, Anabaena
 and plants like 
Azolla
 are used 
as biofertilizers.
In the last year, we have studied the tissue 
culture. Genetic improvement of the plants has 

become possible due to tissue culture and besides, 

those characters inherited to next generation.
2.
 
Animal Husbandry
Two main methods as artificial 
insemination and embryo transfer are used 
in animal husbandry. It helps to improve 
both, the quantity and quality of animal 

products. Ex. Milk, meat, wool, etc. 
Similarly, animals with more strength 
have been developed for hard work.
3.
 
Human Health
Diagnosis and treatment of the diseases are two important aspects of the human health 
management.Biotechnology helps to identify the role of gene, if any, in disease of a 
person. Diagnosis of diabetes and heart diseases has become possible even before the 
onset of symptoms, with the help of biotechnology. Diagnosis of the diseases like AIDS, 
dengue can be done within few minutes. Hence, treatment can be done at the earliest.
Various medicines are used for the treatmentof diseases. Ex. The hormone insulin is 
used in treatment of diabetes.Earlier, insulin was being collected from the pancreas of 
horses. However, nowadays, due to biotechnology, insulin can be prepared with the help 
of bacteria. For this purpose, human insulin gene has been inserted into the genome of 
bacteria. Various vaccines and antibiotics are also produced in the same way. 
a.  Vaccines and Vaccination: 
Vaccine is the ‚antigen™ containing material given to 
acquire either permanent or temporaryimmunity against a specific pathogen or disease. 
Traditionally, vaccines were prepared with the help of pathogens. Completely or partially 
killedpathogens were used as vaccines. However, due to this, there were chances of 

contracting the disease in case of some persons. Hence, as an alternative, scientists tried 
to artificially produce vaccines with the help of biotechnology. For this purpose, scientists 
produced the antigen in laboratory with the help of gene isolated from the pathogen and 
used it as vaccine. Thus, safer vaccines are being produced.

Indian Institute 
of Science 
has developed a transgenic 
variety of tobacco. If cattles 

feed upon leaves of this plant, 

they do not contract a viral 

disease- rinderpest.
Do you know ?
Now, proteins which act as antigen are injected in pure form instead of injecting the 
killed or semi-killed pathogens. These proteins keep the persons away from the diseases 

by keeping the immune system active. Thus, injecting the antigens is safest way in 

vaccination. Vaccines produced with the help of biotechnology are more thermo-stable 

and remain active for longer duration. Ex. Vaccines of polio, hepatitis, 
Edible Vaccines:
 Work on production of edible vaccines is in progress and presently, 

potatoes are being produced with the help of biotechnology. These potatoes are called as 

transgenic potatoes.  These potatoes will act against bacteria like 
Vibrio cholerae, Escherichia 
coli.
 
Consumption of these raw potatoes generates the immunity against cholera and the 
disease caused due t
o 
E. coli.
 What will happen if these potatoes are cooked for consumption?
b. Treatment: 
Biotechnologyis useful for production of hormones like insulin, 
somatotropin and blood clotting factors.
c. Interferon:
 This is a group of small sized proteinmolecule used in treatment of viral 
diseases. These are produced in blood. However, nowadays, with the help of biotechnology, 
transgenic E. coli are used for production of interferon. 
d. Gene therapy:
 Gene therapy to treat genetic 

disorders in somatic cells has become possible 
due to biotechnology. Ex. Phenylketonuria(PKU) 
arises due to genetic changes in hepatocytes (liver 
cells). It has become possible to treat it with gene 
therapy. This method is called as somatic cell 
gene therapy. All the cells except sperms and ova 
in the body are called as somatic cells
e.  Cloning:
 Production of replica of any cell or organ or entire organism is called cloning. 
i. Reproductive cloning:
 A clone can be produced by fusion of a nucleus of somatic cell 
with the enucleated ovum of anybody. Thus, there is no need of sperm to produce the new 
organism.

Peeking into History
A sheep ‚Dolly™ was born in Scotland 

by cloning technique on 5th July 1996. 

Nucleus from the udder cell of sheep 

of ‚Finn Dorset™ variety had been 

introduced into enucleatedovum of 

Scottish sheep. Then, the ovum was 

allowed to develop in the uterus of 

Scottish sheep and thereby the ‚Dolly™ 

had been born. It was showing the 

characters as per the chromosomes in 

nucleus and any characterof Scottish 

sheep was not visible.
Microbialtechniques are already in use for 
treatment on sewage and solid waste. Sewage is 

rich in organic matter. If such sewage is released 

in natural water bodies like rivers, the organic 

matter in it gets oxidized with the help of 

dissolved oxygen. Due to this, level of dissolved 

oxygen in water decreases, adversely affecting 

the aquatic life. As a remedy on this, sewage 

should be released in to rivers only after 

oxidation with the help of microbial technique.

Stem cells can be derived from the cell 
formed in laboratory by the union of somatic cell 

nucleus with the enucleated egg cell. Various 

diseases can be treated with the help of these stem 
cells. 
Similar to cells, genes can also be cloned 
and millions of copies of same gene can be 
produced. Those can be used for gene therapy 
and other purposes.

DNA fingerprinting:
 DNA sequence of each person is unique as that of the 
fingerprints. Due to this, identity of any person can be established with the help 
of its available DNA. This is calledas DNA fingerprinting.It is mainly useful in 

forensic sciences. Identity of the criminal can be established with the help of any 

part of its body found at the site of crime. Similarly, identity of father of any child 

can be established. This research is performed in Center for DNA fingerprinting and 

Diagnostics, Hyderabad. 
 
Cleaning of OilSpillage in Oceans: 
If oil spillageoccurs, it adversely affects the 
marine life. Now, cleaning the ocean without any harm to environment in cheaper 

way has become possible with the help of oil-digesting and fast multiplying bacteria. 
India born Americancitizen and scientist Dr. Anand Mohan Chakravarti had for the 
first time suggested the use of such microbes. Naturally, the credit for this discovery 

goes to him.
 
Bioremediation 
means either absorption or destruction of toxic
 
chemicals and harmful 
pollutants with the help of plants and microorganisms. If plants are used for this purpose, 

it called as ‚phyto-remediation™. Some examples of bioremediation are as follows-

 
The 
Pseudomonas
 bacteria are useful for cleaning the hydrocarbon and oil pollutants 
 
from soil and water.
 
The fern 
Pteris vitata
 can absorb the arsenic from the soil.
 
Genetically modified variety of Indian mustard can absorb selenium from soil.
 
Sunflower can absorb uranium and arsenic.
 
The bacterium 
Deinococcus radiodurans
 is highly radiation resistant organism. It has  
 
been genetically modified and used to absorb the radiations from radioactive debris.
*
 
Grasses like alfalfa, clover and rye are used in phyto-remediation.
Important stages in agricultural development
Green revolution
Dr. Norman Borloug
Dr.M.S Swaminathan 
Improvised dwarf varietiesof wheat and rice, proper use of fertilizers and pesticides 
and water management has led to the increased production of food grains and thereby 

large population had been saved from hunger. Dr. Norman Borlaug (USA) and Dr. M. S. 
Swaminathan (India) have valuable contribution in green revolution.
  
 
Problems of population 
explosion were 
started to appear at the beginning of 20th 
century. Almost all the countries, especially 

underdeveloped and developing countries had 

been badly affected by the effects of poor 

quality and quantity of food. Various methods 

applied for harvesting maximumyield from 

minimum land are collectively called as green 

revolution. 

97
White revolution
 
Various parts of India were rich in milk and milk products. However, those products 
were not sufficient to meetthe needs of far-flung regions. Dr. Verghese Kurien proved 
through the cooperative movement and use of biotechnology that Dairy cannot be allied 

but it will be a mainstream business. He put the cooperative dairy movement of Anand, 

Gujarat at all time high status.

organisms 
with the help of water is called as blue revolution. 
Farm ponds and the fishes are very commonin East 

Asian countries. However, people are not only 

thinking of cultivating the fishes and shrimps but 

other aquatic plants and animals too. Government 

of India has vowed to increase the production by 

encouraging the people for pisciculture by launching 

the program ‚Nil-Kranti Mission-2016™ (NKM-16). 

50% to 100% subsidies are offered in this case.

Institute of Sciences, National Pomegranate Research Institute, Solapur. 

98
Apiculture
 
You must have seen the bee hive. Worst method of harvesting / collecting the honey 
from these hives is driving away the bees by smoking the hive with burning torch and then 
cutting the hive into pieces. This method causes the destruction of hive and large scale 

death of bees. However, it is easy to collect the honey without destroying the hive and 
bees, if artificial bee boxes are used. 
Organic farming
 
Now 
a days, organic farming and 
organic products have become buzzwords. 
Organic products are being available and 

demand for them is ever-increasing. 
Chemical fertilizersand pesticides 
have been used on large scale. These 

poisonous chemicals reached the human 

body through food and water and their 

adverse harmful effects on human and 

environment became apparent. 
Upper layer of the soil essential in agricultureis formed 
due to humus formation. Various essentialelements likeN, 

P, K can be available to crops due to earthworms and fungi. 

In soil-less farming i.e. hydroponics, liquidchemical 

fertilizersare used. However, there are more harmful effects 

of liberal use of chemicalfertilizers. It includes decrease in 

fertility of soil.
Insecticides
 
Though 
the natural immunity of plants can prevent the 
infections, use of insecticides is not under control. Irrespective 
of the natural friends of farmers like frogs and insectivorous 

birds, pesticides are used on large scale for increase in yield. 

Pesticides are in fact a type of poison. This poison enters the 

food-web through water and food and its bio-magnification 

occurs. Various pesticides like DDT, malathion, 

chloropyriphos, etc. have been proved to be dangerous.
 
Various problems like soil fertility 
and 
pest infestation have become serious. So as 

to overcome these problems, farmers are 

opting for organic farming. It includes 

complete ban on chemical fertilizers and 

pesticides and use of local, sturdy varieties 

and thereby maintaining natural balance. 

Definitely, this is a welcome decision.

Elders always instruct you to get out of the home to interact with 
relatives and others and play outdoor games but not to spend time 

continuously with television, phone and internet.
Let™s Think
 
Why the children of your age are instructed same in each home?Our lifestyle has 
been changed to some extent in this age of technology. Each person is busy with own daily 

routine work and favourite job only. How much is it scientifically correct?
Earlier, we have studied the importance of physical health, cleanliness and staying healthy. 
However, the concept of health does not end with it only.

Out of the various aspects of social health, we thought about only one in the above 
mentioned activity. Social health is the ability of a person to establish relationship with 
other persons. Ability to change one™s own behaviour according to changing social 

conditions is an important characteristic of social health. Various factors like strong 

personality, having large number of friends and relatives, proper use of time during 

lonelinessand with peer-group, trust in others, respectand acceptance for others are 

important for good social health. We have seen that various factors affect the social health. 
Factors disturbing the social health

Mental Stress
Competition has increased in opportunities for education, employment and business 
due to increase in population. Children are facing the problems of loneliness and mental 

stress due to reasons like nuclear family and parents staying outdoors due to job. 
9.2 Mental Stress
There are many bindings on girls and excessive freedom for 

boys in some families. Boys enjoy the concession from their 

domestic duties whereas girls have compulsion for the same 

on the pretext that ‚should be used to it™. Do you see the 
advertisements about increasing awareness on avoiding the 
discrimination between girls and boys or sister and brother 
in same family on choice for fresh/left-over food, learning 

medium? In society too, adolescent girls have to 

unnecessarily face the problems like teasing and molestation. 

Girls are facing the problem of stress due to such gender 

inequality. 
 
Nowadays, everyone 
has to face the stress due to ever increasing disorder, crime and 
violence. At the same time, people looking at this as ‚fast and easy way of making money™ 

may become scapegoats and become part of such system. This is the deadly effect of 

social illness.
9.3  Addiction control 
 
Addiction
Peer-group influence is stronger in case of 
adolescents. Adolescents always prefer the 

company of friends and follow theirgood or 

bad habits instead of following advice of 

parents and teachers. Children in their early 

age try upon tobacco, cigarette, gutkha, 

alcoholicdrinks, drugs, etc. due to either peer
-
-group pressure or symbol of high standard 

living or as an imitation of elders. However, it 

may lead to addiction to such deadly substances. 

Temporarilyintoxicating drugs of plant origin 

and some chemicals may permanently damage 

the human nervous system, muscle system, 

heart, etc. Earlier, we have studied the 

carcinogenic effect of tobacco containing 

substances on mouth and lungs.

103
Chronic diseases 
Ignorance towards the people 
suffering from chronic diseases like 
AIDS, T.B, Leprosy and Mental 

health / disorders and old persons 

leads to increase in old age homes 

and this may cause harm to social 

health.
Have you ever seen the persons inebriated with drugs or liquor loitering on dirty 
places? Whether such a pitiful condition of most intelligent human being is acceptable?
You must have read the news about many deaths due to poisonous liquor. Why does 
it happen? 
Liquor is produced from alcohol obtained through fermentation of substances. 
However, if this process is performed in a wrong way, poisonous liquor is produced and 

proves fatal for many at a time. Efficiency of nervous system (especially brain) and liver 

as well as lifespan of person decreases due to alcoholism. Brain development in adolescents 

is hindered due to alcoholism and thereby abilityof memorization and learning becomes 

slow. Addictiveperson cannot think rationally. Due to this, the person has to face the 

social, mental and familial illness along with physical illness.

104
Now a days, excessive, unnecessary and irrational use of modern technology and 
communication media is becoming a sensitive issue through the view point of social health. 
Persons spending the time with cell phones for several hours are usually unaware of the 
surrounding. This is also a sort of addiction and leading to endangering of the social health. 
Various physical problems like tiredness, headache, insomnia, forgetfulness, tinnitus, 
joint pains and problems in vision may arise due to radiation of cell phones. More serious 

fact is those radiations penetrate the bones of children more effectively than the bones of 

adults. Persons continuously using the computers and internet become solitary. They cannot 
establish harmonious relations with relatives and other members of the society. Habitually, 
they become self-centered and thereby they may develop problems like autism and 

selfishness. They become less sensitive towards others. Chronic effect of such tendency is 
that they are not ready to help others in need and hence they also do not get it in need.

Children who watch the cartoon films may
 
imitate the characters of those films. Tendency  
and behaviour of the children who play the games 

like virtual war and car races (especially  

deliberately brought about virtual accidents in  

games) gradually become negative. Some games 

available on cell phones and computers are 

extremely time-consuming and also cause 

economic losses, to lose concentration on some 

essential subjects and may also prove fatal.  
 
Along with some useful purpose, huge
 
information available on internet is used for  

viewing some inappropriate videos too. However,  

there is a governmental regulation over such 

media. Website, movies and cartoon films 

inappropriate for children are banned by the 

government.  
 
Why is there increase in news of death by

selfie?
 
There is 
increasing competition to upload the

Person indulging in such destructive and 
unnatural activities is usually under stress and 
such activities are bursting of stress. Medical 

science has declared such activities as mental 

illness. 
Person indulging in selfie is not aware about 
the world around and the risks. This is called as 

selfiecide. Persons indulging in domestic 

violence, sending messages to others before 

committing suicideor those who send the video 

clips of suicidal act are mentally ill and they do 

so to win the sympathy. 
Cyber crimes
 
Banks continuously spread the message on mobile 
phones about not to disclose the aadhar / PAN 
/ credit 
card  / debit card number and other personal information 

if demanded by any person.
 
Do not disclose your PIN to anyone while withdrawing 

cash from 
ATM machine or purchasing through card 
payment. Why such instructions are given?
 
Consumers are decei
ved by showing superior items on 
websites but actually selling the items of either inferior 

quality or impaired ones.
 
Bank transactions 
are done using PIN without the 
knowledge of consumers.
 
Confidential 
information about government, institutes 
and companies is obtained from internetwith the help 

of computer programs or other ideas and misused. This 

is called as hacking of information. 
 
Nowadays, crimes like opening a fake account on 

Facebook and displaying false information 
and thereby 
teasing the girls or exploiting them financially.
 
Misuse or illegal 
sale of the written literature, software, 
photos, videos, music, etc. of others by obtaining from 

internet is called as piracy.
 
Ele
ctronic media is also misused by sending derogatory 
messages, spreading vulgar pictures and inflammatory 
statements.
Hence, make the constructive use of communicationmedia like television, phone and 
internet for essential needs and entertainment only but do not go into their clutches by 
spending hours with those media.

ctronic media is also misused by sending derogatory messages, spreading vulgar

Exchange of information through media 
like email, Facebook and Whatsapp occurs 
very fast. However, our personal information and phone numbers are automatically 
spread and thereby reaches the unwanted persons which leads to malpracticeslike 
incoming of unnecessary messages. Some of such messages either impair of shut down 
the mobiles and computers.
 
All the above mentioned incidences are examples of cyber crime. Committing 
such 
crimes is also a mental illness. Later on, the criminal also has to face the mental stress. 

‚Cyber crime unit™ has been newly launched in police department.Cyber crime experts 
collect the details, investigate the cyber crime and thereby find the criminal with the help 
of internet.
Stress management
 
Have you seen the loudly laughing 
citizensin morning in public gardens? 
Name of this newly popularized concept 

is ‚laughter club™. These people relieve 

their mental stress by laughing loudly. 
Various ways of expression like 
establishing communication with friends, 

peers, cousins, teachers and more 

importantly parents, noting down our 

feelings, expressing our feeling with near 

and dear ones help us to relieve the stress. 
Fostering the hobbies like material 
collection, photography, reading, cooking, 
9.10 Laughter Club
sculpturing, drawing, rangoli, dancing, etc. help us to properly utilize the free hours. By 

diverting the energy and mind towards the positive thinking, negative thoughts are 

automatically neutralized. 
Do You Know
IT Act-2000: This act has been enacted since 17th October 2000 and been amended 
in 2008. Person committing the cyber crime has to face the punishment like imprisonment 

for 3 years of fine up to 5 lakh. Maharashtra is at forefront in controlling the cybercrimes 

and it has been proved to be a first state to start a separate cyber 
crime unit.
Can you tell ? 
Why do you wait for periods of music, P.T., drawing in the 
classroom?
 
Learning and listening to the music, singing keeps us happy and drives away the 
stress. Music has the power of changing the mindset. Importance of outdoor games is 

unparallel. There are various benefits of sports like it causes physical exercise, improves 

discipline, interaction and tendency of unity, loneliness is driven away and person becomes 

more social.

107
 
Nature is closest friend of human 
being. Hobbies like gardening, bird 
watching, lingering in nature, rearing 

domestic animal, etc. helps to create 

positive mindset, improves confidence. 

Social health can be maintained by 

keeping ourselves aware about 

happenings around us, neutralizing the 

negative thoughts (ex. revenge), etc.

of problem. Children contact the 

helpline to narrate their problems. Proper help and guidelines are offered to children.
Regular exercising, massaging, visiting 
the spa too help to relive the stress. Yoga is 
not limited for asanas and pranayam but it 
includes discipline, balanced and good food, 

and meditation also. Deep breathing, yogic 

sleep, yogasanas, etc. are good for health. 
Meditation helps to improve the ability of 
concentration. It imparts positivity in our 
temperament. Meditation helps the students 

to improve concentration in their studies. 

Deliberate inculcation of characters like time 
management, planning of our own duties and 
decision power is nothing but cultivating the 
socially strong and ideal personality.
We have all the ways to manage our stress. However, if those are not successful due to 
certain reasons, it leads to some more serious problems like depression and frustration. Medical 

advice, counselling and psychotherapy are available for such persons. Similarly, many NGOs 

also provide helping hand. Let us see the information about some of those.

Disaster
 
Variously dangerous events occur many times in the environment. Those are called as 
disasters. Some of the main natural disasters are floods, wet and dry famine, cyclones, 
earthquakes, volcanoes, etc. These are ‚all of a sudden™ troubles to the mankind. Such 
events cause sudden changes in the environment and thereby cause the damage to it. En
-
vironment is also damaged due to use of natural resources for our development. This leads 
to sudden disasters, unexpected to human. These can be called as man-made disasters.

United Nations has defined the disaster as ‚the sudden eventthat leads to the huge loss of 

life and property. Words like ‚huge™ and ‚sudden™ are importantin the definition. As the 
disaster occurs suddenly, it cannot be predicted. Hence, precautions are not possible. Huge 
losses to the property occur in the area of disaster. There are long term effects on society 
due to incidences of life and property loss. Various areas of life like economic, social, 

cultural, political, law and administration, etc. are affected by it.  The life in the area of 

disaster disturbs totally. There is loss to life and property of the people in distress. 
Earlier, we have studied various types of disasters and the measures to be taken. None of 
the different disasters are similar. Period of each disaster is not same. Some disasters are 
short term where as some are long term. Reasons behind each disaster are also different. 

Depending upon the nature of disaster, it can be determinedthat which component of the 

environment will be affected more. 
1. What is disaster?

2. Which disasters have you experienced in your area?
3. What are the effects of that disaster on local and surrounding 
 
     conditions?
Can you tell?
 
Which are two main types of disasters?
 
Earlier, 
we have studied the effects of various types of disasters and the precautionary 
measures to be taken in case any disaster happens. We can classify the disasters in other 

ways too; like catastrophic disasters. Ex. Cyclones in Odisha, catastrophic earthquakes of 

Gujarat and Latur, frequently buzzing cyclones in coastal Andhra Pradesh, etc. which lead 

to total chaos, huge loss of life and property in respective region. However, irrespective of 

all these, life has always returned to normal within short time. Disasters making the impact 

for long duration are those whose after-effects are either severe or severity increases with 

time. Ex. Famine, various problems of crop, strikes of workers, rising levels of oceans, 

desertification, etc.

Effects of disaster
 
We have understood the serious effects of disaster with the help of above-mentioned 
questions. Collapsing of bridges, flooding of coastal villages, shortage of food are some 
of the problems of floods. Collapsing of houses, developing cracks in land are some of the 
effects of earthquake. Disasters like forest fire and drought also adversely affect the envi
-
ronment. However, what is exact nature of these disasters? Whether there are any changes 

in nature before the occurrence of disasters? For how long the effects occur after the oc
-
currence of disaster? How? It needs to be think over all these aspects. This helps us to 
understand the nature and gravity of the disaster. 
 
Disasters definitely 
affect the economy of the nation. That effect is always relative to 
disaster and economy i.e. if any port is destroyed, there are long lasting effects on econo
-
my due to huge expenses on its reconstruction. An effect of disaster on social leadership is 
that if local leadership is not strong enough, citizen become confused. It affects their par
-
ticipationin rescue and rehabilitationactivities.Administrativeproblems arise during the 
disaster. If local governing bodies are affected by disasters, related departments cannot 
answer the problems of disaster efficiently. All the concerned departments are affected by 
disaster and thereby entire system collapses.
