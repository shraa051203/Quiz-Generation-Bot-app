Please do not teach \n\nwithout planning. \n \nThe teaching-learning interactions, processes and \n\nparticipation of all students is very necessary and \n\nso is your active guidance. \n \nPlease use the geographical teaching aids in the \n\nschool as required for the appropriate understanding \n\nof the subject. It is necessary to use the globe, the \n\nmaps of the World, India and the State, atlases, \n\netc.\n \nThough the number of chapters has been reduced \n\nthe number of periods required for each chapter \n\nhas been given a thought. Abstract concepts are \n\ndifficult to follow and therefore you are expected \n\nto use the given number of periods fully. Do not \n\nfinish the chapter in short.  This will help the\n \nstudents to assimilate the content without feeling \n\nthe ‘burden of learning’. \n \nLike other social sciences, geographical concepts \n\ntoo are not easy to understand. Major concepts of \n\ngeography have a scientific base and they deal \n\nwith abstractions. Encourage group work, learning \n\nthrough each other\n’s help, etc. Facilitate peer \n- For Teachers -\nlearning as much as possible by reorganizing the \n\nclass structure frequently. \n \nDo not ask questions on statistical information.\n \nInstead, ask questions on their trends or patterns. \n \nThe present book has been prepared for constructivist \n\nand activity-based teaching.\n Please do not teach the lessons in the book by just \nreading them aloud. \n \nFollow the order of the chapters as given in the \n\ncontents because the concepts have been introduced \n\nin a graded manner to facilitate knowledge-\n\nbuilding. \n \nDo not use the boxes titled ‘Do you know?’ for \n\nevaluation.\n \nUse QR Code given in the textbook. Some websites \n\nhave been given for reference at the end of the \n\nchapter. Also, a list of references used is also\n \ngiven. You as well as the students are expected to \n\nuse these references. These references will surely \n\nhelp you to go beyond the textbook. Please bear in \n\nmind that extra reading is always helpful for \n\nunderstanding any subject in depth. \n \nUse thought-provoking, activity-oriented, open-\n\nended, multiple choice questions for evaluation.\n \nSome examples are given at the end of the chapters \n\nin the ‘exercises’.\n \nUse outline maps given on page numbers 35 and \n\n60 for photocopy.\nWhile preparing the textbook for Class X, the need \n\nof comparative study was taken into consideration. \n\nIt was envisaged that the textbook must contain at \n\nleast two regions and that regional comparison \n\nbetween two states within a country must be avoided. \n\nConsidering the countries, it was obvious that India \n\nwould be one country. But which country should be \n\nchosen as the second one was given a lot of thought. \n\nFollowing criteria were considered for the same. \n\n• The country should not be very developed or \n\nunderdeveloped.\n\n• Should be located in a different hemisphere. \n\n• Shouldn’t be from the same continent. .\n\n• Should be quite similar to India but also different \n\nfrom India in some cases.\n\n• Should have cultural and natural diversity like \n\nIndia.\n\n• Should be a member of international organizations \n\nalong with India. \n• Should have a coastline like India.\n\n• Should have a democratic form of government. \n\n• There should be some similarity in historical \n\nbackground.\n\n• The application of the concepts taught till Class Nine \n\ncan be applied on the same level to both the countries. \n\n•  While studying the comparison of two countries will \n\nbecome noticeable and there will be an increase in \n\nrespect for India. \n\nOn the basis of all the criteria above, Brazil was \n\nselected. The application of the geographical concepts \n\non only one region loses its charm. Therefore, studying \n\ntwo regions with respect to regional diversity, similarity \n\nand dissimilarity, etc. is necessary for its study. The \n\ncore of geography lies here. Therefore, it is expected \n\nthat the selection of Brazil along with India would be \n\nmeaningful.\n\nSr.No.\nChapters\nAreaPage No. \nExpected Number \nof Periods',

    'FIELD VISIT\nDiscuss\nDAY': "1- 06:00 hours.\nTeacher:Dear students, now we have left Naldurg and are on our \nway to Solapur. We will have our breakfast at Solapur \nand lunch near Sinhagad, Pune. Now all of you \n\nshould observe both the sides along the roads and \n\nnote down observations in notebooks with reference \n\nto these points:\n  \nrelief \nwater bodies \nvegetation \nsoil,  \nagriculture \nhuman settlement \nsettlement patterns.  \nRahul:Yes, Madam. I can see that we are experiencing \nundulating topography and somewhere in between \n\nwe can find plains. We can also see some agricultural \n\nfields. \nBesides personal luggage and I-Cards, students are carrying the \nfollowing items with them. \nRahul is going on a field visit with his classmates and school teachers from Naldurg in \nOsmanabad district to Alibag in Raigad district. The school has engaged a special bus from State \nTransport for this purpose. Rahul and his classmates have organized this visit under their teachers’ \n\nguidance. Let’s find out how the students are experiencing the changes occurring in the relief, soil, \n\nvegetation and human settlements as they travel from Naldurg to Alibag.\nGo through the following conversation between the teachers  and the students. \n\n2\nSakshi : We can see small settlements along the roads. We \ncan also see tea stalls, \ndhaabas\n, petrol pumps and \nother shops. \nTeacher : Yes Meena, your observations! \nMeena : Madam, are we going  down the slope? \nTeacher: Correct! Now we are in the southern part of the \nBalaghat Ranges. They are the eastern off-shoots \n\nof the Sahyadris. Keep looking at the map given to \n\nyou and the topography outside. You can easily see the \n\nchanges occurring in the landscape. Now, tell me \n\nabout the settlement patterns and housing types.\nSuraj : Madam, in rural areas, we see houses in a straight \nline along the road. The walls of the houses are \n\nmade of clay while use of mud and wood is visible \n\nin making the roofs.\nRenuka : In this area, we can mainly see dry grass. Trees \nwhich have shed their leaves are visible in some places. \nTeacher : Good observation, Suraj and Renuka ! Such settlements \nare called ‘linear settlements’. We have learnt that in \n\nseventh standard. The houses which you saw are called \n\nmud and wood houses (\ndhabyachi ghare\n).  These are \n\nthe traditional houses built by a specific method. The \n\nvegetation here belongs to the dry deciduous type.  They \n\nshed their leaves during a specific season.   \n  (After some time, they reach Solapur city)  \nTeacher : Now we have reached Solapur city. In urban areas, the \npopulation density is high. We see multi-storeyed houses. \nThey are  made of a mixture of cement, sand, rubble and \n\nwater. They are constructed using bricks. Shops with \n\nmodern amenities like shopping malls, big restaurants, \n\netc. are found along the roads.\n  (Students started observing the distinctive characteristics \nof the urban area. After sometime, the teachers asked \n\nRahul  to distribute the breakfast packets among the \n\nstudents. They had their breakfasts.)\nTeacher : Now we are crossing Solapur city. Dear students, see \nthe cultivation around. What do you see? Observe \n\nand tell.\n  (Children observed on both sides of the road \nand started writing down their observations in their \n\nnotebooks. This continued for a long time.)\nSavitri : Madam, I find that the fields are greener here. When we \nhad left Naldurg, we had seen shrub crops and there was \n \n  What precautions will \nyou take continuously \nduring the field visit?\n  Collect more information \nabout mud and wood \n\nhouses (\ndhabyachi ghare\n).\nFigure 1.7 : Cultivation of \npulses \nFigure 1.5 : Roads and shops \nFigure 1.4 : Mud and wood \nhouses (\ndhabyachi ghare\n)\nFigure 1.6 : Vegetation of the \nsemi-arid region\n  Correlate pulse cropping \nwith low rainfall.\n\n3\n  Obtain information \nregarding multi-purpose \nprojects.\n‘Vegetation is an \nindicator of difference \n\nin precipitation’. What \n\nare the other indicators \n\nof difference in \n\nprecipitation? \nFigure 1.8 : Sugarcane Field\nFigure 1.9 : Ujani Dam \nReservoir \nFigure 1.10 : Types of trees\n               some sugarcane but now I can see that it is mainly \nsugarcane being cultivated here.\nTeacher : Correct! When we had left Naldurg, we had seen \ncultivation of \nmoog, urad\n and other pulses but \nnow it is mainly sugarcane. This is because of the \navailability of irrigation facilities. \nSavitri : Yes, madam.  We had crossed a canal some time \nago and now I can see a large reservoir here. Which \n\nis this  reservoir, madam? \n  (Near Indapur, the teachers asked the bus driver to \nstop at the side of the road. The students got down \n\nin a line and gathered around the teachers in a \n\ndisciplined way) \nTeacher : Refer to your maps. As shown there, what you can \nsee to our right are  the backwaters of the Ujani \n\ndam built on the river Bhima. This dam is mainly \n\nused for supplying drinking water. It is also used for \n\npower generation, fishing, irrigation, etc. (Some students \n\nclicked pictures of the surroundings. They boarded the \n\nbus and their journey started again.) \nPooja : Madam, this seems to be a plain area. \nTeacher : Yes, we are going through a plain region. This is a part \nof the Deccan Plateau itself. As we go westwards,  we \nwill notice major changes in the relief and vegetation. \n\n(After few hours of journey, they left the main road near \n\nHadapsar and turned towards Sinhagad. There were \n\nmany big and small hotels at the foothills. They stopped \n\nat an open space at the roadside and had their lunch. \n\nThey relaxed for a while.)\nNazma : I also noticed that when we left Naldurg, trees like jujube \n(bor), babool etc. were visible any one should be there \n\nbut here different trees are seen.\nTeacher : Good !  While crossing Naldurg, we saw semi-arid thorny \ntype of vegetation.  Change in type of  vegetation is an \n\nindicator of change in the amount of rainfall in that area. \n\nWe see that anjan (ironwood) , banyan and peepal trees \n\nare more in number here. Alright,  now  we have reached \n\nthe foothills of Sinhagad. Now we will climb to the top \n \nand you will see the off-shoots  of Western Ghats. You \n\nwill only carry your I-card, notebook, pen, binoculars, \n\ncamera, cap, map and water bottle. Keep your luggage \n\nand other items in the bus itself.  \n  (When they started climbing the Sinhagad fort, it was \n\n4\n  How will the terrain \nbelow appear to the \nbirds  from the sky?\n  Out of which process \nhas the plateau of \n\nMaharashtra formed  ? \n\nWhat is the main type \n\nof rock seen here?\nFigure 1.13 : Khadakwasla \nDam as seen from Sinhagad \nFigure 1.12 : Rocks ( debris)\nFigure 1.11 : Sinhagad \nEntrance Gate \nFigure 1.12 : Rocks ( debris)\nFigure 1.14 : Layers of Rocks\n  quite sunny at first, then it became cloudy. Later, it also \nstarted drizzling and students enjoyed eating steamed \ngroundnuts,  buttermilk and curd on the way. They \n\nclicked photographs of various physical features, the \n\nvegetation around, birds, the aerial view of Pune city and \n\nthe various  structures of the fort. Afterwards, teachers \n\nasked them to gather at one place) \nTeacher: We have now reached the fort of Sinhagad. How will \nyou collect information about it? \nNeha : Madam, we saw a board at the entrance which gave \nus information about the Sinhagad Fort. We have also \n\nclicked its pictures. \nTeacher : Good, Neha. Now who will tell the differences in the \nrelief features now?\nQasim : Madam, we can see that now the undulating plains \nhave turned into rugged topography with hills. This \n\nis a high hill. We are at a higher altitude and hence \n\ncan even experience clouds.\nTeacher : Very good  Qasim! You can notice many physical \nfeatures like rock pinnacles, valleys and hills and layers \n\nformed from volcanic eruption. Have you recognized the \n\nrock found here?  You might have seen some debris of \n\nlandslides at places while climbing. Now, tell me \n\nabout the agricultural pattern around! \nRahul : Madam, this is basalt , an igneous type of rock. We \nhad learnt about it in Class 6. \nMary : We saw mainly pulses being cultivated at the place \nwhere we live. Between Solapur to Pune , we saw \n\nsugarcane. Now we see  mainly paddy fields.\nTeacher: Correct. It is because of the good amount of rainfall \nhere. Can you recall seeing a similar fort-like  structure \n\nbefore? What difference do you see between both of \n\nthem?\nWahida: Madam, we can compare this with the Naldurg fort \nitself. But it is not situated on a hill like Sinhagad. We \n\ndo not have to climb up a slope to see it.\nTeacher : Very good. Now, we have reached the top of the fort. \nThis is a hill fort as it has been built on a hill. This \n\nwas built with the view of security and to keep an eye \n\non the surroundings. Naldurg is a fort on the land. All \n\nsuch forts are the heritage of our State.\n  Come here and look down. The water body that you \ncan see in front is the reservoir of   the Khadakwasla \n\n5\n Gather information \nabout forts. Consider \nthe following points \n\nfor it- determination \n\nof location,period \n\nof construction, \n \nconstruction style and \n\nsecurity mechanism.\nFigure 1.15 : Paddy cultivation\nFigure 1.16 : Devtake\nFigure 1.17 : Food items at \nSinhagad\n  dam which serves water to areas in and around Pune. \nNow we will go to the Kalyan Darwaja (Gate). Come \nhere and see this structure. This is called Devtake.\n\n(sacred tank). Water coming from a natural spring \n\ngets stored here. Even today it serves water all the \n\nyear round to the people who stay at the fort above.\nAll students :(expressing surprise) : Oh my God! How can \nwater be available continuously at this height since \n\ncenturies? \n  (The teachers took them to a stall which served \npithla-\n-bhakri\n. Students observed that there were many similar \n\nstalls. Tourists were being served different food items \n\nthere. After spending little time at Sinhagad fort, students  \n\ncame down the foothills and boarded the bus. The bus \n\nstarted towards Pune city where they had an overnight \n\nhalt. In the city, they had evening snacks and tea and got \n\nready to roam in the markets.)\nTeacher : We will be visiting places in Pune like \nShaniwarwada, and famous market places like \n\nTulsibag and Mahatma Phule mandai (market). \n\nThere are wholesale and retail markets here. You \n\ncan do shopping here. Make sure you write down all \n\nyour observations. \n  (After the city-tour they had dinner and returned to \nthe place of their night halt)  \nDAY 2 - 07:00 hrs\n  (After breakfast, they proceeded to Alibag)\nTeacher \n: Now, we are on the Mumbai-Pune Expressway. Can \nyou see the change in the relief again? We will stop at \nRajmachi point near Lonavala.\nTushar : Yes,  madam. Even though we are driving on a plain \nroad, we can see hilly regions all around. The frequency \n\nof houses is becoming less. \n  (After Lonavala, they stopped at Rajmachi point and the \nteacher gave information about various relief features) \nTeacher : These are the slopes of the Western Ghats. We call these \nhilly areas Sahyadris too. From here you can observe \n\nthe difference in slopes- the gentle slope to the east and \n\nthe steep slope to the west. Towards the west, you can \n\nsee many cliffs and waterfalls about which you have \n\nlearnt in Class IX. This region is  also the source of river \n \nUlhas, a major west-flowing river.\n\n6\n  Do you agree that regions \nand necessities influence \nthe difference in the \n\nmeans of livelihood? \n  Guess in which season \nof the year is the field \n\nvisit being undertaken? \nFigure 1.19 : A waterfall in \nSahyadris \nFigure 1.18 : Rajmachi \nFigure 1.21 : A Vanrai\nFigure 1.20 : A  'Devrai’.\n  (The students took photographs of these features, it \nstarted raining again and their journey resumed.)\nNamdeo : (Looking at the map) Madam. We are crossing the \nGhat section and now are we going to Khopoli?\nTeacher : Correct Namdeo, This is known as the Bhor or \nKhandala ghat in the Western Ghats. We will now \nenter the western coastal plains of India. Observe the \n\ntrees, soil and houses that you see. \nShiv : Madam, we can see dense forests comprising of thick \nvegetation in the Ghats. We can see trees with broad \n\nleaves. We had seen such trees in the  Sinhagad \n\nregion too. \nTeacher : These are the teak trees. This region is a region \nof  deciduous trees. There are many \nvanrais\n and \ndevrais\n. (woodlands and sacred groves)\n  (After crossing the Ghats, the dense forest became \n \nsparse. Paddy fields and huge industrial estates were  \n\nnow visible.) \nNazma : Madam, I can feel a change in the weather. It is getting \nhotter and I have started perspiring. \nTeacher : You feel the change in the air. Because of increase in \nhumidity in the air, we start perspiring and skin becomes \n\nsticky. As we go near the sea, this will increase. \nNamdeo: Madam , it has started raining in this region. Also, \nthe amount of rainfall seems to be more. It might be \n\nhappening because of this. \nTeacher : Namdeo, correct observation. Because of heavy \nrainfall and nearness to the sea, this happens. Also, \n\nbecause of high rainfall, rice is the major crop here. \n  Soon, we will reach the sea, Can you name the sea? \nAll students : (together) the Arabian Sea ! \n\nTeacher : Good! After reaching Alibag, before we go to our \nlodges, we will visit the Talathi office. You can \ngather information on the basis of the questionnaire \n\nyou have prepared in the school. \nUrmi : We will be asking him questions about the types \nof crops, soil types, cultivation of fruits and other \n\ncash crops. We are asking him how land revenue \n\nis collected in his/her office, land under irrigation, \n\nwatershed programmes and other occupations in the \n\nvillage.\n\n7\n  What is  the concept of \n'Devrai’.\nFigure 1.22 : Teak Trees \nFigure 1.23 : Kolaba Fort  \n  What precautions have \nto be taken while going \nto the sea coast?\n  What is the simplest \nmethod of understanding \n\nthe timings of the tides? \n  (They reached Alibag in the afternoon and then \nvisited the Talathi office. They collected information \nbased on their questionnaires.)\nTeacher : Dear students. After lunch , we will go to the sea \ncoast. How many of you will be seeing the sea for \n\nthe first time?\n  (Almost all  of them raised their hands)\nAbeera : I am just trying to imagine what a breathtaking view \nit would be to see the sea.! What will it look like? Or \nwill there be just water!\nTeacher : True, Abeera, we will visit the beach now. We have \nalready given clear instructions regarding precautions to \n\nbe taken there.  We will also visit a fort called Kolaba or \n\nAlibag fort here. We will have to take into account the \n\ntimings of the high and low  tides as this is little away \n\nfrom the coast in the sea. We have studied the work of \n\nsea waves  in Class IX. We will also identify some of the \n\nlandforms formed by sea waves. Can you name some of \n\nthem? \nAll children: (almost together) beach…. sea caves…wave-cut \nplatforms, sand bars……\nTeacher : Good! You remember them well. \n  (They visited the beach and the fort. Some of them \nalso enjoyed sitting on horse-driven chariots and \nsome of them enjoyed horserides.) \nNeha : Madam this fort is different from the first two. \nTeacher : Good Neha. Can you tell the difference between \nthem?\nNeha : Yes, Madam. This fort was constructed in water \nwhile other two were on land. \nTeacher : Good, this fort is built on a wave-cut platform. Because \nit is surrounded by sea water, it is called a sea-fort. \nEarlier, these forts were built for the security of the seas. \n\nThere are many such  forts on the west coast.\nNeha : Yes, I have heard names like Sindhudurg, Janjira earlier. \nTeacher : Based on the information you have collected, can you \ntell what occupations are followed here?\nRahul : Madam, fishing and agriculture, both the occupations \nare followed here. \nTeacher : Correct, Rahul! To which category do these occupations \nbelong ?  \n\n8\n  What type of \nphotographs will you \nclick with respect to the \n\nfield visit?\n  On the basis of which \npoints will you write the \n\ntour report?\n  During field visit, how \nwill you obtain various \ntypes of information?\nFigure 1.24 : Alibag beach  \nAnswer in short : \n (1) Make a  report on your field visit.\n \n(2) Prepare a questionnaire for a field visit to a \nfactory.\n (3) How will you manage the litter during the \nfield visit?\n (4) What items  will you take with you for the \nfield visit?\n (5) Outline  the  importance  of field-visit.\n               \n***\nThe above text is a sample of a field visit.

India got its independence\n \nin the year 1947. Despite facing several problems \nlike three wars, famine situations in various parts \n\nand similar issues after independence, India is a \n\nmajor developing country of the world. India is \n\nconsidered to be a global market too.

The country is divided into five major\n \nphysiographic divisions\n The Himalayas \n The North Indian Plains\n The Peninsula \n Coastal Plains \n Island groups.  \nHimalayas :\n The Himalayas is one \nof \nthe young fold mountains in the world.                     \nThe Himalayas extend from Pamir Knot in \nTajikistan to the east. It is a major mountain \n\nsystem of the Asian continent. In India, it     \n\nextends from Jammu and Kashmir to Arunachal \n\nPradesh. \nThe Himalayas is not a single mountain \nrange. There are many parallel ranges in the \n\nsystem. The southernmost is known as Siwaliks. \n\nIt is also the youngest range. Next to Siwaliks \n\nare Lesser Himalayas, Greater Himalayas \n\n(Himadri) and Trans Himalayan ranges from \n\nsouth to north. These ranges are young to old \n\nrespectively.\nThese mountain ranges are also divided \ninto Western Himalayas (or Kashmir \n\nHimalayas), Central Himalayas (or Kumaun \n\nHimalayas) and Eastern Himalayas (or Assam \n\nHimalayas). \nNorth Indian Plains :\n This division lies \nbetween Himalaya Mountains in the north and \n\nthe Peninsula in the south. Similarly, it extends \n\nfrom Rajasthan and Punjab in the west to Assam \n\nin the east. It is mostly a flat low lying area.The \n\nNorth Indian Plains are divided into two parts.\n\nThe part lying to the east of the Aravalis is the \n\nbasin of the river Ganga and is therefore known \n\nas the Ganga Plains. It slopes eastward. \nMost of the West Bengal State of India\n \nand Bangladesh together constitute the delta \n\nof Ganga-Brahmaputra system. It is known as \n\nSunderbans. It is considered to be the world’s \n\nlargest delta. See Fig 3.3.\n      \nThe western part of the North Indian Plains is \n\noccupied by desert. It is also known as Thar \n\nDesert or Marusthali. Most of Rajasthan is \n\noccupied by this desert. To the north of the \n\ndesert lie the plains of Punjab. This region \n\nis spread to the west of Aravalis and Delhi \n\nranges. These plains have formed as a result \n\nof the depositional work by river Sutluj and its \n\ntributaries. The slope of the plains is towards \n\nthe west. Because the soil here is very fertile, \n\nagriculture is largely practised in this region.\nThe Peninsula :\n The area lying to the south \nof North Indian Plains and tapering towards\n \nthe Indian Ocean is called Indian Peninsula. \n\nIt consists of many plateaus and hill ranges. \n\nThe Aravalis in the north are the oldest fold \n\nmountains here.  It includes a series of plateaus \n\nbordering the Plains, Vindhyas and Satpuda \n\nranges in the central part and the hilly regions \n\nof Western and Eastern Ghats. \nCan you tell ?\nOn the basis of  Fig 3.1, answer the \nfollowing questions:\nIn which direction do  the Aravalis lie ?\n  \nAravali ranges act as a water divide \nbetween which rivers?\nName the hills located on the plateaus to \n\nthe east of Aravalis.\nAcross which states has the Deccan Plateau \n\nspread? \nFigure 3.3 :  The image of Sunderban Delta   \n\n17\n Which hill ranges lie to the west of the \nDeccan Plateau? \nEnumerate the characteristics of the \nWestern Ghats. \n Compare the Eastern and the Western \nGhats. \n Why are the Western Ghats called a water \ndivide?\nThe Coastal Plains :\n India is blessed with \na long coastline extending for approximately\n \n7500 km. It lies to the western and eastern \npart of the Peninsula. Its western and eastern \n\ncoastlines show remarkable dissimilarities. \nThe western coast borders the Arabian \nSea. It is by and large a rocky coast. At places, \n\nspurs taking off from the Western Ghats have \n\nextended right up to the coast. Its width is also \n\nless.  Rivers originating from Western Ghats are \n\nshort and swift and hence they form estuaries \n\nand not deltas. \nThe eastern coast borders the Bay of \nBengal. It has formed as a result of depositional \n\nwork of rivers. Many east flowing rivers starting \n\nfrom the Western and Eastern Ghats meet this \n\ncoast. Because of the gentle slope of the land, \n\nrivers flow at lower velocities and deposit the \n\nsediments brought with them at the coast.  As a \n\nresult, deltas are found along this coast.\n \nThe Island group :\n India has many \nsmall and large  islands along the coast of the\n \nmainland. These are included in the coastal \nisland group. Besides, India has two large group \n\nof islands, one each in the Arabian Sea and in \n\nBay of Bengal. The islands in the Arabian Sea \n\nare known as Lakshadweep whereas the islands \n\nin the Bay of Bengal are called the Andaman \n\nand Nicobar Islands. \nMost of the islands in Lakshadweep are \natoll islands. They are small in extent and not \n\nvery high. \nIslands in the Andaman group are mainly \nvolcanic islands. They are large with hills in \n\ntheir interior parts of includes an island called \n\nBarren Island which has the only active volcano \nin India.  There are atolls in the Nicobar group \ntoo. \nBrazil :\nEven a cursory look at the map will \nmake you realize that a large part of Brazil\n \nis occupied by highlands, plateaus and small \nmountains. There are no very high and long \n\nextending mountains in the country. Except for \n\nthe northern Amazon basin and in southwest \n\nalong the upper parts of Paraguay basin, there \n\nare no wide plains in the country. Even the \n\ncoastal plains are restricted in their expanse. \n\nThe physiographic divisions of Brazil are as \n\nfollows. \n \nThe Highlands \n \nThe Great Escarpment\n \nThe Coastal region \n \nThe Plains\n \nThe Island groups\nThe Highlands :\n The southern Brazil \nis occupied by an extensive plateau. It is\n \ndifferently described as Brazilian Highlands or \n\nBrazilian Shield or Brazilian Plateau. Brazilian \n\nand Guyana Highlands together form the core \n\nof South American continent. \nThe main part of the Guyana highlands \nis in Venezuela and it extends upto French \n\nGuiana. In Brazil, it covers the states of \n\nRoraima, Para and Amapa in the north. The \n\nlower part of these highlands is found in Brazil. \n\nBut the highest peak of Brazil, Pico de Neblina, \n\nis 3014 m high and lies on the border between \n\nBrazil and Venezuela. \nThe regions to the east and south of the \nBrazilian highlands have an altitude of more \n\nthan 1000m. But in other parts, the altitude \n\nis between 500 to 1000m. The highlands \n\ngradually slope towards north and slopes are \n\nnot very steep. The tributaries of Amazon \n\nflowing through this region make rapids and \n\nwaterfalls.  Towards the north the slopes are \n\nsteep but not abrupt. A number of rivers take \n\noff from the terminal portion of the highlands \n\nand flow northwards to meet Atlantic Ocean. \n\n18\nSome major rivers like Uruguay, Paraguay \nand Parana originate from the southern slopes \nof the highlands and enter Argentina. Its slope \n\ntowards the east is steep and it appears in the \n\nform of an escarpment. \nThe Great Escarpment :\n Though it \noccupies a very small area, the nature of its\n \nslope and  the effect it has on the climate makes \n\nit a separate physiographic region. The eastern \n\nside of the Highlands is demarcated because of \n\nthe escarpment. In this region, the altitude of \n\nthe escarpment is 790m. In some regions, the \n\nheight decreases gradually. The escarpment is \n\nvery steep particularly from Sao Paulo to Porto \n\nAlegre. The escarpment act as a barrier to the \n\nSoutheast Trade winds giving rise to the rain-\n\n-shadow area in the northeastern part of the \n\nhighlands. The region to the north of this area \n\nis called ‘Drought Quadrilateral’.\nThe coasts :\n Brazil has a coastline of \nabout 7400 km. One may divide that into two\n \nparts namely northern and eastern coast. The \n\nnorthern coast extends from Amapa province \n\nin the north to Rio Grande do Norte in the east. \n\nThis can be called as the North Atlantic coast. \n\nFrom there, the eastern coast extends towards \n\nthe south. \nThe northern coast is  characterized by \nmouths of many rivers including the Amazon. \n\nTherefore this region is a low-lying region. On \n\nthis coast lie the Marajo island, Marajo and \n\nSao Marcos Bays. Marajo is a large coastal \n\nisland located between the mouths of River \n\nAmazon and River Tocantins. \nThe eastern coast receives large number \nof smaller rivers. The only major river which \nmeets the Atlantic Ocean here is Sao Francisco. \n\nThe Brazilian coast is characterized by a large \n\nnumber of beaches and sand dune complexes. \n\nThe Brazilian coast is protected in some areas \n\nby coral reefs and atoll islands.\nThe Plains :\n The plains in Brazil are \nconfined to two areas namely the Amazon basin\n \nin the north and Paraguay-Parana source region \n\nin the southwest. Amazon plains lying between \n\nthe two highlands form the largest plain land \n\nof Brazil. Amazon plains lying in the northern \n\nparts of Brazil generally slope eastwards. The \n\nAmazon basin is quite wide in the west (about \n\n1300 km) and it narrows eastward. Its width \n\nis minimum where the Guyana Highlands and \n\nBrazilian Highland come closer. (240 km.) As \n\nthe river approaches the Atlantic Ocean, the \n\nwidth of the plains increases. These are mostly \n\nforested areas and largely inaccessible due \n\nto frequent flooding and dense undergrowth. \n\nMost of the Amazon plains are covered by \n\ntropical rainforests. \nThe other plains in Brazil are located to \nthe southwestern part of the highlands. They \n\nform the source region of Paraguay and Parana \n\nrivers. The source region of Paraguay slopes \n\ntowards the south while the source region of \n\nParana slopes towards the southwest.                                                  \nPantanal is one of the largest wetlands in \nthe world. It lies towards the southwest part of \n\nthe highland areas . It is a region of swamps \n\nand marshes in northwestern Mato Grosso do \n\nSul in Brazil and it extends into Argentina too.\nIslands :\n Besides the mainland, some \nislands are also included in Brazil. They can \n\nbe classified into coastal islands and marine \n\nislands. Most of the coastal islands have formed \n\ndue to deposition. Marine islands were a part of \n \nthe mainland.  They are more than 300 km away \n\nfrom the mainland in the Atlantic Ocean. These \n\nislands are mostly rocky and they are the top \n\nof the submerged mountains. The islands near \n\nthe coast of the South Atlantic Ocean are coral \n\nislands and they are called atolls.\nDo you know ?\nPraia do Cassino or Casino Beach is the \nsouthernmost  beach of the Brazilian coast on the \nSouth Atlantic Ocean. It is considered to be the \n\nlongest sandy beach in the world. It is a continuous \n\nbeach extending for more than 200 km\n\n19\nAny other point(s).\nSome more information :\n \nGanga \nRiver \nAmazon River \nTotal catchment \narea ( in sq.km)\n10,16,124 70, 50, 000\nTotal length of \nriver ( in kms) \n2,525 6,400\nWater discharge\n( Cu.m. per sec ) \n16 , 648 2,09,000\nGeographical explanation\nBrazil :\nDrainage of Brazil :\nAs far as the drainage \nin Brazil is concerned, there are three major\n \nriver Basins.\nAmazon Basin\nParaguay-Parana system in the southwest \nSao Francisco in the eastern part of \nhighland and other rivers at the coasts \nAmazon basin :\n Amazon collects its headwaters \nfrom the eastern slopes of Andes Mountains in\n \nPeru. Amazon River receives huge discharge. \n\nThis is about 2 lakh m3/s . As a result, Amazon \n\nwashes off the load supplied to it from the \n\ncatchment. Consequently, sediments are not \n\ndeposited even at the mouth. A dense network of \n\ndistributaries, which is a characteristic feature \n\nof river mouth areas, is by and large absent in \n\nthe mouth region of Amazon. Instead we find a \n\nseries of islands developed along the mouth of \n\nAmazon beyond the coast line in to the Atlantic \n\nOcean. It will be interesting to note that at the \n\nmouth the width of Amazon channel is 150 \n\nkm. (Take into consideration a place  which is \n\n150kms away from your home. You will get an \n\nidea of the width). Most of the course of the \n\nAmazon river is suitable for navigation.\nDRAINAGE\n :\nColours of Both\nFigures 3.1 and 3.2 show the physiography \nof India and Brazil.

The entire basin of this river is\n \nwithin Brazil. It occupies the eastern portion \n\nof the highlands. The river flows towards the \nnorth for a distance of about 1000 km over the \n\nplateau and then takes a sharp eastward turn \n\nto enter the coastal strip along the Atlantic \n\nOcean. The river is navigable for a distance \n\nof about 250 km in its downstream reaches. \nCoastal Rivers :\n Brazil has a number \nof short coastal rivers.

In summers when glaciers melt, the \ndischarge of water increases in summer. They \n\nflood during monsoons too. They are perennial \n\nrivers.\nThe drainage covers two major river \nsystems such as Indus river system and \n\nGanga river system.  Indus and its tributaries \nAtlantic Ocean collect their headwaters along \nthe escarpment. River Puraguaco enters the \n\nAtlantic Ocean near Salvador town.\n  \nIndia :\nDrainage of India :\n Rivers in India are largely \nclassified according to their source region into\n \nHimalayan and Peninsular rivers.\n\n22\nThe west flowing rivers occupying the area \nbetween the Western Ghats and the Arabian \nCoastline are short in length but swift. This \n\ncondition of short and swift river system exists \n\nin the states of Kerala, Karnataka, Maharashtra \n\nand Southern Gujarat. \nFurther northwards one comes across the \nriver system flowing in to the Gulf of Khambhat. \nThese river systems are Tapi, Narmada, Mahi \n\nand Sabarmati. \nTapi and Narmada flow slowly through  rift \nvalleys. Mahi River flows from North East to \n\nSouth West direction whereas River Sabarmati \n\ncollecting its headwaters from the southern \n\nslopes of Aravali ranges flows in somewhat \n\nNorth-South direction. Another noteworthy \n\nriver forming the catchment of Arabian Sea \n\nis River Luni. It originates along the western \n\nslopes of Aravali range and flows in somewhat \n\nnortheast to southwest direction and flows into \n\nGulf of Kutchch.\nRivers meeting the Bay of Bengal : \nMost of the area of the Peninsula is drained \n\nby the rivers flowing towards Bay of Bengal.\n \nThe important river systems of this group are \n\nMahanadi, Godavari, Krishna and Kaveri. \n\nMahanadi basin occupies the northeastern \n\npart of the Peninsula. Godavari, Krishna and \n\nKaveri originate in the eastern slopes of the \n\nWestern Ghats.\nRiver Godavari is the second largest river \nsystem of India in terms of the catchment area.\nTo the south of Godavari is located the \nbasin of River Krishna. It’s major tributaries \n\nare Bhima and Tungbhadra. \nRiver Kaveri flows through the states of \nKarnataka and Tamil Nadu. It is one of the \n\nmajor rivers of Peninsula. It is a river that has \n\nbeen harnessed for irrigation since a long time.\n(Jhelum, Chenab, Ravi and Satluj)  drain the \nWestern Himalayas i.e. they flow through \n\nJammu and Kashmir and Ladakh. They flow \n\nalmost parallel to each other. \nA major tributary of river Indus , the \nSatluj, originates near Man Sarovar and flows \n\nwestwards.  Punjab Plains have been formed \n\nthe depositional work of this river and its \n\ntributaries. Indus flows through Pakistan and \n\nthen meets the Arabian Sea. \nThe river Ganga originates from the \nGangotri glacier and crosses the Himalayas to \n\nbecome an east-flowing river. Many tributaries \n\nof the Ganga also flow in a similar manner. \n\nYamuna, originating at Yamunotri, is a major \n\ntributary of Ganga.\nAnother major tributary of the Ganga \nflows through the northern part of the \n\nGreater Himalayas, crosses the Himalayas \n\nto enter India. When it flows through the \n\nHimalayas it is called Tsang Po. When it \n\ncrosses the Himalayas, it is called Dihang \n\nand its eastward flow thereafter is called as \n\nBrahmaputra. From time to time, Ganga meets \n\nits trbuatries, hence its discharge increases. \n\nGanga receives Brahmaputra as its tributary \n\nin its lower reaches in Bangladesh. The huge \n\nvolume of water and huge deposition has led \n\nto the formation of a large delta. Besides these \n\nHimalayan rivers, a number of tributaries from \n\nPeninsula like Chambal, Ken, Betawa, Shon, \n\nDamodar etc. drain into the Ganga basin.\nPeninsular Rivers :\n The Peninsular river \nsystems can further be divided into east\n \nflowing (meeting the Bay of Bengal) and \n\nwest-flowing (meeting the Arabian Sea). The \n\nWestern Ghats form a major water divide in \n\nthe Peninsula. The peninsular rivers, being \n\nrain fed rivers, seldom face the problem of \n\nfloods. They are seasonal in nature.\nFind out.\nMany geologists say that the rivers of  \nthe Himalayas are older than the Himalayas \nthemself. Try to find out the reason behind this.  \nDo you know ?\nThe coastal rivers in Kerala have long \nextending backwaters near their mouths. \nThese water bodies are  locally known as \n\n‘Kayals’\n\n23\nQ 1.

How much is it?\nWhat type of climate will be found in Rio \nDe Janerio ? \nGeographical explanation\nBRAZIL:\nBecause of the vast latitudinal extent of \nBrazil, it experiences wide range of climatic\n \nvariations in climate. For example near equator \nit is hot while temperate type of climate is \n\nfound near Tropic of Capricorn. Brazil gets \n\nrainfall from the South-East Trade winds and \n\nthe North-east Trade Winds. \nParts of the Brazilian highlands extend \nupto the northern coast. The escarpments act as \n\nan obstruction to the winds blowing from the \n\nsea and cause orographic type of rainfall in the \n\ncoastal region. Beyond the highlands, the effect \n\nof these winds gets  reduced. As a result,  the \n\nrainfall is minimal. This region is a  rainshadow \n\nregion. This region is called 'Drought \n\nQu adrila ter a l'.  Considering the temperatures in  \n\nBrazil, the northern part of Brazil is hot while the \n\n28\ntemperatures in the southern part are \ncomparatively lower. Seasonal variations are \n\nfound in this pattern. Near the equator at Brazilian  \n\ncoast, temperature does not vary much.\nIn the coastal regions near the equator \nin Brazil, differences in temperatures are \n\nnegligible. The winds move in the vertical \n\ndirection in this region. Similarly, the \n\nconvergence zone of the trade winds is weak \n\nhere. As a result,   cyclones are not formed. \n\nThat is why tropical cyclones \nrarely visit the \n\ncoasts of Brazil. \nMost of the part of this country lies in the \ntropical zone. The equator passes through the \n\nnorthern part of the country. The temperature is \n\nmore in this region. The average temperature in \n\nthe Amazon valley is 25 ° - 28° C . The climate is \n\ncooler in the Highlands . Because of the proximity \n\nto the sea, the coast experience mild and humid  \n\nclimate. The Amazon valley receives around  \n\n2000 mm of rainfall, while the north-eastern  \n\ncoast receives 1000 to 1200 mm of rainfall.  \nCan you tell ?\nStudy the graphs given in figure 4.5 and \nanswer the following questions:\nWhat difference do you find in the rainy \nseasons of Chennai and other cities of \n\nIndia?

The \nsunrays are perpendicular upto the Tropic of \n\nCancer , which passes through the middle of the \n \ncountry . As a result,  average temperatures are \n\nhigher  throughout the year.

In winters,  , the \ntemperatures drop  to - 40° Celsius in  Jammu \n\nand Kashmir and parts of mountainous regions \n\nof Himalayas.\nThe diversity in climatic conditions of India \nis due to   the latitudinal location and altitude of \n\nthe place. The Indian Ocean and the Himalayan \n\nranges exert a great influence on the climate of \n\nIndia and the origin of Monsoons. \nVery cold winds blowing from the north \nare obstructed by the Himalayas. Similarly, \n\nthe South–West Monsoons retreat from \n\nthe Shiwalik and Himachal ranges of the \n\nHimalayas. Because of high temperatures in \n\nsummers, low pressure area develop in Punjab \n\nplains and the Thar desert of Rajasthan. This \n\nattracts winds blows from the high pressure \n\nregion in the Indian Ocean which start \n\nblowing towards the mainland of India. These \n\nmoisture-laden winds bring rainfall. Because \n\nof the obstruction caused by the Eastern and \n\nWestern Ghats, it rains more in the coastal \n\nareas.  The rainfall reduces in the leeward side \n\nof the hills. These winds blow parallel to the \n\nAravalis. As a result, rainfall is low in parts \n\nof Gujarat and Rajasthan. Later, these winds \n\nmove towards the Himalayas. Their moisture-\n\n-carrying capacity increases. Orograpghic \n\ntype of rainfall occurs because of the natural \n\nobstruction of the Himalayas. These winds \n\nreturn from the Himalayan ranges and their \n\nretreating journey starts. While blowing from \n\nthe north-east towards the Indian Ocean, these \n\nwinds bring rainfall again to some parts of \n\nthe Peninsula. This is the Retreating Monsoon \n\nseason in India. In general, the climate of India \n\nis hot throughout the year.\nAs the Tropic of Cancer passes through \nthe middle of India, India is considered to \n\nbe in the tropical region.

Due \n\nto farming, industries and trade, the proportion \n\nof the population got concentrated in few places.  \n\nFor example, the northern plains of the country,  \n\nDelhi, Kolkata, Mumbai, Pune, Bengaluru,  \n\nChennai, etc. On the contrary, in  mountainous \n\nhilly regions, dry desert areas, dense forest areas,  \n\ndensity is sparse because of inaccessibility, \n\nabsence of facilities and tough life.\n\n39\nUse your brain power !\nFigure : 6.2 (a) :\n Population Distribution in Brazil\nFigure : 6.2 (b) :  Population density in Brazil\nN\nBRAILIAS\nB      R A Z      I      L\n0          300        600         900         1200\nKm\nBRAZIL\nPopulation Distribution\n2010\n1 Dot = 2,00,000 People\nSOUTH ATLANTIC OCEAN\nNORTH ATLANTIC OCEAN\nN\nLess than 50\n51-100\n\n101-150\n\n151-300\nMore than 300\nAMAZONAS\nMATO GROSSO\nPARA\nMARANHAO\nCEARA\nPARAIBA\nALAGOAS\nSERGIPE\nBAHIA\nMINAS GERAIS\nRIO DE JANEIRO\nPIAUI\nAMAPA\nSAO PAULO\nPARANA\nSANTA\nCATARINA\nRONDONIA\nACRE\nBRASILIA\nB      R AZ      I      L\n0          300        600         900         1200\nKm\nPARANAMBUCO\nRORAIMA\nRIO GRANDE\nDO NORTE\nMATO GROSSO\nDO SUL\nESPIRITO SANTO\nRIO GRANDE\nDO SUL\nINDEX\nMANAUS\nSOUTHATLANTIC OCEAN\nNORTH ATLANTIC OCEAN\nBRAZIL\nPopulation Density\n2010\n(Per Sq.

With a population \nof around 19 crores, according to Census \n\n2010, it ranks 5th in the world . It is also the \n\nfifth in the world with respect to area. Brazil \n\noccupies 5.6 % of world’s total land and has \n\n2.78% of world’s total population. Therefore, \n\nthe density of population is around 23 persons \n\nper sq.km.\nThe distribution of population is very \nuneven in Brazil. The majority of Brazilians \n\nhave concentrated within 300 kilometers of the \neastern coastal plain. Therefore, agriculture \n\nand industries have flourished well here. As a \n\nresult, higher density of population is found here. \n(b)\n(a)\nOn the other hand, the interior in the Amazon \n\nBasin is very sparsely populated. Unfavorable \n\nclimate, heavy rainfall, inaccessibility and \n\ndense forests are the barriers to development of \n\nhuman settlements here. Therefore, settlements \n\noccur only in few places in the Amazon basin.\nThe central and western part of Brazil is \nless populated. The density of population in the \n\nhighlands of Brazil is moderate.\n\n40\nGeographical explanation\nWith reference to both the countries, the \ncharacteristics of population are prominently \nnotable.\nThe sex ratio of Brazil has been more than \n1000 since decades.\nConsidering the sex ratio of Brazil, the \nnumber of women have considerably \n\nincreaesed than men since 2001.\nIn India men outnumber women.\nIn India we see fluctuations in the sex \nratio since few decades. There has been a \n\nslight increase in the sex ratio after 1991.\nPOPULATON COMPOSITION :\nSEX RATIO :\n \nFigure 6.3 \nAlways remember \n-\n‘Save Girl, Teach Girl’ \nis the need of the hour in our \ncountry.\nGive it a try.\nWhat could be the reasons of lower sex \nratio in any region? \nIn India, number of men outnumber women. \nIs this condition found in all the States of \n\nIndia?

Now the settlements have \n\ndeveloped and are densely populated. The major \n\nreasons of development are as follows\nAlthough the coastal climate is hot and \nhumid, and flat land is limited due to rugged \n\ntopography, the region has a good water supply \n\nand a large range of natural resources. e.g. Sao \n\nPaulo.\nSao Paulo  has extensive area under rich \n   \nExamples of Settlement Patterns in Brazil :\nsoil which makes it ideal for growing coffee.           \n\nIt \nalso has a large supply of natural minerals              \nclose by, such as iron ore and it also has a               \n\nsteady energy supply. The South Eastern area \n\nhas a  good transport system too.  This makes              \n\nthe Sao Poulo area a nucleated settlement. \n\nSee Figure 7.3.\nRural areas such as the north-east \nHighlands suffer from extreme droughts, which \n\nmake it difficult for practising agriculture and \n\nhence settlements are sparse here.\nSettlements become sparse as we move in \ntowards the central part of Brazil. Given are the \n\nmajor reasons : \nArea is covered by thick dense equatorial \nrainforests (see fig. 7.4).\nThe climate here is unhealthy and unfit for \n\nsettlement. \nLimitations on use and exploitation of \n\nnatural resources.\nPoor transport links in the region.\nFigure 7.4 : Rain Forest in Amazon River Basin\n\n48\n31.16% which is quite low in comparison to \ndeveloped countries. At the same time, the \n\nurban population is increasing expansion of the \n\nurban centres and emergence of new towns have \n\nplayed a significant role in the growth of urban \n\npopulation and urbanisation in the country.\nUrbanisation has been more in the \nsouthern part than in the northern part in India. \n\nGoa is the most urbanised state with 62% \n\npopulation living in urban areas.

Production of maize is largely \n\nconcentrated in the central part. Commercial \n\ncrops like coffee, cocoa, rubber, soyabean and \n\nsugarcane are cultivated on a large scale. Brazil \n\nis the largest exporter of coffee and soyabean \n\nin the world. The major states growing coffee \n\nare Minas Gerais and Sao Paulo. Besides \n\nthese crops, production of fruits like bananas, \nFigure 8.3 \npineapples, oranges and other citrus fruits \n\nis also done.

What could be the reasons?\nConsidering the availability of resources, \nwere has the development of industries \noccurred?\nMake friends with maps !\n\n55\nGeographical explanation\nThe eastern part of Brazil is rich in various \ntypes of minerals like Iron ore, manganese, \nnickel, copper, bauxite, tungsten, diamonds, \n\netc. Inaccessibility, lack of knowledge of \n\npotential reserves of resources, dense forests, \n\netc are factors which have led to limitations \n\nin mining in the interior parts of the country. \n\nNevertheless, because of increasing demand in \n\nthe country, mining work has developed well in \n\nthe highland region.\nFishing :\nAnswer the questions on the basis of fig 8.3.\nCan you give two reasons of concentration \nof fishing near the south-eastern coast of \n\nBrazil? \nInland fishing is not developed in Brazil \n\nthough there is large number of rivers in \n\nBrazil. Can you think of a reason?\nThe following images are related to \nagricultural activities. Identify and write \n\nwhether they are practiced in Brazil or India.\nGive it a try.\nName the warm  and cold ocean currents \nnear Brazilian coasts.\nLet’s recall.\nDo you know ?\nThe United States Dollar is used during \ninternational transactions at the international \nlevel. $ is the symbol of this currency. \n\nBrazilian Real (BRL) is the currency of \n\nBrazil. R$ is the symbol of this currency. \n`\n is \nthe symbol of Indian currency.\n\nOne American dollar = R $ 3.1297 \n\nOne US $ = \n`\n 64.153\n(Note- These rates of currency are always \n\nchanging. )\nGeographical explanation\nBrazil has a sea coast of around 7,400 \nkm and excellent fishing grounds off the South \nAtlantic coast. The meeting of the warm Brazil \n\ncurrent and the cold Falkland current off the \n\ncoast of south-east Brazil makes it a good \n\nfishing ground. Traditionally, fishing has \nbeen carried on by small groups of individual \n\nfishermen using primitive techniques and \n\nequipment. But now, large vessels are being \n\nused. Swordfish, shrimp, lobsters and sardines \n\nare mainly caught. The fish resources of the \n\n56\nAmazon River are not exploited much and \nfishing only takes place on a small scale.\nAgriculture in India :\nTry this.\nShow the distribution of crops like wheat, \njowar, rice, cotton, sugarcane, tea and apple \n\nin the outline map of India using symbols. \n\nName the map.\nGeographical explanation\nUnlike Brazil, India’s agriculture \ncontributes more towards GDP and also \n\nengages a larger chunk of population. Around \n\n60% of land in India is under cultivation. Its \n\nenormous expanse of level plains, rich soils, \n\nhigh percentage of cultivable land, wide \n\nclimatic variety, long growing season, etc \n\nprovide a strong base to agriculture. In India, \n\nagriculture has been a long standing activity.\nIndian agriculture is mainly subsistence \ntype. India produces rice, wheat, maize, \nsorghum and millets as major food crops; \n\nplantations of tea, coffee, rubber and cash \n\ncrops like sugarcane, cotton, jute, etc are also \n\nproduced. India is also a major producer of a \n\nvariety of fruits and vegetables. \nFishing in India :\n Fishing plays an important \nrole in the economy of India. India is one of\n \nthe largest producers of fish, both marine \nand inland. Fisheries help in augmenting \n\nfood supply, generating employment, raising \n\nnutritional level and earning foreign exchange. \nFish forms an important part of the diet \nof many people living in the coastal areas of \n\nKerala, West Bengal, Orissa, Andhra Pradesh, \n\nTamil Nadu, Goa and Maharashtra. India has \n\nabout 7500 kms of coastline. Marine fishing \n\naccounting for about 40 per cent of the total \n\nannual production of fish and being confined \n\nto coastal waters in the west from Kachchh, \n\nMalabar coast to Coromandal coast in the east. \n\nMajor fishes are sardines, mackerel, Bombay \n\nduck,and prawns. On the eastern coast, the \nimportant fish are horse mackerels, clupeids \n\nand silver bellies.\nWith the help of the pie chart given \nin fig. 8.2, tell what is the contribution of \nsecondary activities in Brazil’s GDP ?\nLet’s recall.\nObtain information regarding \npisciculture in India with the help of internet \n\nand reference books and write a note.\nFind out.\nMining In India :\n The Chhota Nagpur plateau \nin India is a big storehouse of different minerals.\n \nMining is the main occupation of the people \nthere. Coal is mined in Korba in Chattisgarh \n\nand in eastern Maharashtra. Mineral oil wells \n\nare found in Digboi in Assam, Mumbai High \n\nin Arabian Sea near Maharashtra, Kalol and \n\nKoyali in Gujrat. Reserves of mineral oil and \n\nnatural gas have been discovered at the mouth \n\nof river Godavari. Stones like marble are found \n\nin Rajasthan and Cuddapah in Andhra Pradesh.\nIndustries in Brazil :\nMajor industries include iron and steel \nproduction, automobile assembly, petroleum\n \nprocessing, chemicals production, and cement \n\nmaking; technologically based industries have \n\nbeen the most dynamic in recent years, but have \n\nnot outpaced traditional industries. Similarly, \n\nfood-processing like sugar industries, cotton \n\ntextiles, silk and woolen industries have \n\ndeveloped well. Most of large industries are \n\nconcentrated in the south and south east. The \n\nnorth east is traditionally the poorest part \n\nof Brazil, but it is beginning to attract new \n\ninvestment.\nFreshwater fishing is carried on in rivers, \ncanals, irrigation channels, tanks, ponds, lakes, \netc.  Silver bellies carp (chopda) etc. are major \n\nfreshwater varieities. About 60 per cent of the \n\ncountry’s total fish production comes from \n\ninland fisheries. \n\n57\nFigure 8.4 : Logos of Various Industries\nIndustries in India :\nLook at fig 8.4. Observe the logos given\nIdentify the industries with which they are \nassociated.\nWhich raw material is used for these \n\nindustries. Classify them accordingly.\nFrom which part of India do they get these \n\nraw materials? Discuss and write.\nThe distribution of industries in India is \nhighly uneven. This is so partly on account \nof uneven distribution of the necessary raw \n\nmaterials and power resources and partly due \n\nto the concentration of enterprises, financial \n\nresources and other necessary conditions in \n\nlarge towns.\nJharkhand, Orissa, adjoining Chhattisgarh, \nMadhya Pradesh, parts of Rajasthan, Karnataka \nand Tamil Nadu account for most of the reserves of \n\nmetallic minerals. This area, therefore, particularly \n\nthe north-eastern part of the peninsula, has a \n\nvery high concentration of heavy metallurgical \n\nindustries with almost all the steel centres situated \n\nhere. Availability of large quantities of coal and \n\nrefractory materials, along with cheap power \n\nfrom the Damodar-Valley Corporation and a \n\nnumber of thermal \npower projects, have added \nto the advantages. Rajasthan has copper, lead \nand zinc; Karnataka has steel, manganese and \n\naluminium; and Tamil Nadu has aluminium \n\nmetal industries.\nAgro-based industries including cotton, \njute and sugar are heavily concentrated in the \n\nraw material-producing areas. The forest-based \n\nindustries including paper, ply wood, matches, \n\nresins and lac are in the forest areas of various \n\nstates. The coastal belt of Kerala has a heavy \n\nconcentration of coir, copra and fish canning \n\nindustries.\nKoyali, Digboi, Noonmati and Bongaigaon \nrefineries are situated close to the petroleum \n\nproducing areas, and Mathura and Barauni \n\nrefineries in the interior, away from the coast \n\nand oil-producing areas. The distribution of \n\ncement industry is also highly conditioned by \n\nthe availability of raw materials.\nGujarat, Rajasthan and Tamil Nadu \nproduce the bulk of salt in the country. \n\nMechanical engineering, electricals, \n\nautomobile, fertiliser, and numerous consumer \n\nindustries, which show little bias for raw \n\nmaterial, have come up all over the country \n\nwith heavier concentration near the big cities.\n\n58\nFigure 8.5 : Contribution of trade in GDP\n Brazil Trade\n(% of GDP)\nIndia Trade\n(% of GDP)\nExport, Import and Balance of Trade (Value in US $)\nIndia\nBrazil \nYear Exports Imports Exports Imports\n2009-10\n178751.4 288372.9152994.7 127647.3\n2010-11\n251136 369770 197356.4 180458.8\n2011-12\n304623.53489181.3256038.7 226243.4\n2012-13 \n214099.8 361271.9242579.8 223149.1\nColours of Both\nIndo-Brazil ties :\nAnswer the following.\nWhat does BRICS stand for?\nWhen was it established? \nWhat are the objectives of this bloc?\nThe countries of which continent are not \n\na member of this bloc? \nIn which continents do the member \n\ncountries lie? \nUse your brain power !\nIf Rajasthan does not have a coastal area, \n\nthen how does it produce salt?\nand India.Trade makes up about 25% of GDP. \n\nSee fig 8.5 below and compare it with India.\nGeographical explanation\nIndia mainly exports tea, mangoes, coffee, \nspices, leather and leather goods, iron ore, \n\ncotton and silk textiles while it mainly imports \n\npetroleum, machines, pearls and precious \n\nstones, gold and silver, paper, medicines, etc. \nIndia’s major trading partners are the UK, \nthe USA, Germany, Japan, China, Russia, etc.\nGeographical explanation\nBrazil mainly exports iron ore, coffee, \ncocoa, cotton, sugar, tobacco, oranges and \n\nbananas while it imports machinery, chemical \n\nproducts, fertilisers, wheat, heavy vehicles, \n\nmineral oil and lubricants.\nMajor trading partners are Germany, \nUSA, Canada, Italy, Argentina, Saudi Arabia \nLet’s recall.\nTrade :\nRead the adjoining table and \nanswer the following questions.\nWhat is balance of trade?\nTell the types of balance of trades.\nIn which country export exceeds \n\nimport in all the years? \nBrazil’s balance of trade belong \nto which type?\nIndia’s balance of trade belong to  which \ntype? \n\n59\nThrough BRICS, Brazil has opened up a \nstrategic partnership with India.

    'TOURISM': ", TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATION\n\n62\nthe GDP of India is higher than Brazil and so \nalso its population, therefore, the contribution of \n\ntourism to GDP appears lesser than Brazil and \n\npopulation engagement seems higher.\nFigure 9.3 : Gateway of India\nFigure 9.4 : Beach at Rio De Janeiro\nSome tourism sites of India and Brazil\nFigure 9.5 : Brazil - Marine Tourism\nFigure 9.6 : Ajanta Caves\nFigure 9.7 : Football Stadium at Manaus\nFigure : 9.8 : Guwahati, Assam\nWhat are the factors responsible for \ndevelopment of these tourism sites in Brazil?\nThink about it.\nIndia :\nIt is seen in figure 9.1 that the number \nof international tourists in India is constantly\n \ngrowing. But this increase appears to be more \n\nafter 2010. This increase in the number of \n\ninternational tourists is consistent. Foreign \n\ntourists visit India for heritage, adventure, \n\ncultural, health and business tourism. \n\nEcotourism is also being given boost in India. \nConsidering the heritage of India, there \nare plenty of opportunities for tourism in many \n\nparts of the country. Many places are being \n\ndeveloped for this.\n\n63\nFigure 9.9\nBrazil Transport :\nStudy the transport map \nof Brazil in Fig 9.3 and answer the following\n \nquestions: \nWhich means of transport are seen on the \nmap?\nWhich means of transport has a denser \n\nnetwork? \nWhich highway can be seen prominently? \n\nWhich places does it join?\nWhat could be the reason of development of \n\nrailways in the South-East?\nIn which part of Brazil do you see a lesser \n\ndevelopment of transport network ? What \n\ncould be the reason?\nGeographical explanation\nThe most common method of transportation \nis roadways. Roadways account for more than \nhalf of transportation \n\nsystem in the country. \n\nBut the density of road \n\nnetwork is concentrated \n\nin the eastern part of the \n\ncountry. The forested \n\nlands of Amazon River \n\nbasin and the swampy \n\nlands have limited \n\nthe development of \n\nroadways in this part. \nWaterways have \nbeen developed on a \n\ncommercial basis in the \n\nAmazon River.

Coastal shipping is also carried out in the \n\ncoastal areas.                       \nRailways have not developed very well \nin Brazil. The use of trains for long distance \n\ntransportation of passengers is restricted to a \n\nfew urban tourist routes though it is cheaper. \n\nThe contribution of airways is less in the \n\ntransportation system of the country. \n      \n\n64\nFigure 9.10\nIndia Transport :\n Look at the transport maps \nof India given in fig 9.10 and 9.11 and answer\n \nthe following questions.\nWhich means of transport are visible on the \n\nmap? \nMake friends with maps !\nIn which part of India is the density of \n\nrailways more? \nName five important ports and airports of \n\nIndia.\nWhich parts of India have a sparse network \n\nof transport? What could be the reason?\n\n65\nGeographical explanation\nAs compared to Brazil, India has a denser \nnetwork of transport. About 85 per cent of \npassenger and 70 per cent of freight traffic \n\nare carried by roads every year. Freight and \n\npassenger transport has been facilitated due to \n\nthe development of the railways.  Railways are \n\nimportant for the growth of the Indian economy. \n\nRailway network is relatively less dense in the \n\nhill states, north eastern states, central parts \n\nof India and Rajasthan while it is dense in the \n\nNorth Indian Plains.\nRailways are very important for a vast \ncountry where distances are large.\n      \n\nCommunication in Brazil  :\nTry this.\nYou are already aware of the vast \nlongitudinal extent of Brazil. Given are the \nThe development of means of transport \nis an indicator of rapid progress of a country. \nAlways remember \n-\nFigure 9.11\nWaterways are \na cheap means of \n\ntransport. Waterways \n\ncontribute about \n\n1% to the country’s \n\ntransportation. It \n\ncomprises rivers, canals, \n\nbackwaters, creeks, etc.\nApproximately \n95 per cent of India’s \n\nforeign trade moves \n\nthrough ocean routes. \n\nApart from international \n\ntrade, these are also \n\nused for the purpose of \n\ntransportation between \n\nthe islands and the rest \n\nof the country.  \nAs compared to \nBrazil, airways in India \n\nare more developed \n\nand the use of internal \n\nairways is also \n\nincreasing.\n    \n   \n\n   \nGive it a try.\nArun called his mother from Digboi \n\nat 7 am.
